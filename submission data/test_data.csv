"FLYOME 4 Pack Invisible Ink Pens with uv Light, 2021 Upgraded Disappearing Spy Pens for Party Favors, Christmas, Thanks Giving Day, Magic Marker for Secret Message and Goodies Bags Toy","These are basically lit toys...but for the pandemic, something that has the kids practicing writing and then dissappearing quietly into a dark closet to read, well, that's value for my money!",positive,positive
"LOOIKOOS Walkie Talkies for Kids, 3 KMs Long Range Children Walky Talky Handheld Radio Kid Toy Gifts for Boys and Girls 3 Pack","The media could not be loaded. So I bought these as a birthday present for my niece and nephew. She turned 4 and he turned 3 and they both LOVE them. They play with their older sister who just turned 10 and they all have a blast. The three pack was perfect for them. The price and the quality are just absolutely unreal. I had so many expensive walkie talkies as a kid that didn’t work well and broke easy. These are sturdy, have a great menu lock so the younger kids can’t accidentally change the channel frequency, they have a flashlight on them so the kids can play in the dark. They also each have a lanyard that can hang around the next which is nice. I also like that the clip comes off. Those things usually snap off on things so I can take it off for the younger ones if I need to. I honestly don’t think you can find a better product for anywhere near this price and this quality. I highly recommend it. Perhaps the one downfall is the kids are keeping their mom awake all hours talking to each other all night ;) but that’s why they also have a headphone jack which is soooo great!",positive,positive
Fisher-Price Little People Caring for Animals Farm Playset with Smart Stages learning content for toddlers and preschool kids,"The media could not be loaded. This Fisher-Price Little People farm is fantastic! It offers a great variety of imaginative play options. My daughter could not get enough of it. I nudged her out of the way for this review and got, “Stop hogging the toy!!” So I had her make the video. THE KID SAYS: There are 3 levels of interactivity. Level 1 involves simplistic explanations of what exactly everything does. Level 2 includes a little routine that the children can act out with the farmer and the animals. Level 3 just includes sound effects. The video shows Level 2. There's a silo that you can turn to “make food”. There's carrots and corn, both of which you can feed to the animals by putting them in the slots on the stall doors. There's a bell you can ring, a weathervane you can turn, eggs that lift up to reveal 5 chicks, a blanket for the cow, and a chute in the barn that you can drop things down. Part of the barn folds up for easy storage. It locks in place. BOTTOM LINE: Your child will be enthralled.",positive,positive

"Gzsbaby 6 Piece Dinosaur Toys for Kids and Toddlers, Blue Velociraptor T-Rex Triceratops, Large Soft Dinosaur Toys Set for Dinosaur Lovers - Perfect Dinosaur Party Favors, Birthday Gifts",I actually was hesitant about these. I thought the material would be foam like but it's a lighter rubber and sturdy for my 3yr old and bigger than I thought they be. I guess I have to get more since my other 2 liked them also.,neutral,positive
"Toyvelt Princess Dress Up Shoes and Jewelry Boutique - Pretend Play For Little Girls Set Incl 4 Pairs Princess Shoes And Lots of Accessories - Toddler Girl Toys For 3,4,5, Year Old and up","Our 4yo was over the moon with this birthday gift. Shoes are big but usable (she wears a 9 toddler), and the bracelets, rings and earrings were just what she had always dreamed of. The packaging is great, as it can be used to store everything. All that said, we had to break out the hot glue gun within the first 30 min to fix flowers that had fallen off. I don't think I'd gift this to a friend -- fine for ourselves, though.",positive,positive

Fisher-Price Little People Animal Friends,The chicken is poorly constructed as show in the photo and some of the animals are poorly painted. I’ve gone through the trouble of trying exchange prior little people sets that arrived looking like this only to receive a different set with the exact same issues and now know not to bother. Disappointing but oh well.,negative,negative
Beat That! - The Bonkers Battle of Wacky Challenges [Family Party Game for Kids & Adults],"Bought 2 of these, one as a gift for my kids and one as a gift for a friend's kids.

Casdon Dyson Cord-Free Vacuum | Interactive Toy Dyson Vacuum For Children Aged 3+ | Includes Working Suction For Realistic Play,"We were so excited to see this toy vacuum for our kids since they love to help clean up, but the first time we got the vacuum it broke within a few days. The second time we received a replacement and it literally broke within less than 24 hours. It’s a cute vacuum and the kids loved it, but it is cheaply made and not durable at all. My kids aren’t rough with toys, but this vacuum is not worth buying. I’m very disappointed in this product, especially since we have to spend time to send it back again and look for something else. Amazons Customer Service was amazing in helping us with the issues though.",negative,negative
"Funko Five Nights at Freddy's Articulated Foxy Action Figure, 5""","as a fan of five nights at Freddy's, these are great collectibles to put on your shelf. however, if your child is young or thinks this is a toy they can take anywhere without a problem, it's not a good buy. the pieces break off very easily, sometimes they can't fit back on. these are collectibles, not toys. stick to the plush stuffed animals if you want a toy for yourself/ someone else. :)",positive,positive
Catan Board Game (Base Game) | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Adventure Board Game | Ages 10+ | for 3 to 4 Players | Average Playtime 60 Minutes | Made by Catan Studio,"I ordered this game in September of 2017 and it took me 2 years to figure out that it was a 3rd party product. I always suspected there was something wrong with it : the house colors are not as vibrant, some of the houses themselves are misshapen, the water edges don't interlock correctly. The final confirmation came when my bf got me the expansion (from Catan Studios) which had the beautiful colors and flawless houses... And I noticed that the manufacturers were different. Catan is still a fantastic game 3rd party or not; however, we ordered a new version from Catan studios, as we like the quality of Catan Studios so much more.",neutral,neutral
SKIP BO Card Game,"We've been playing it nightly (husband and me). We deal out only 20 cards (plus the 5) and play 3 games a nite, keeping score. So, it's he wins most games...but if I can get a win of TWO GAMES in one night...I practically die from exhilaration. (Doesn't happen on most nights...maybe once or twice. Rare.  If I get ONE game won, I'm pretty happy. IT's THE CHALLENGE OF IT ALL THAT KEEPS ME ASKING TO PLAY EVERY NIGHT!  MY DAY wiLL surely come!) It's not exactly 'bible typing monkies' ...  although it is a simple game in concept. BUT, I am always challenged...do I try to block him (and disadvantage myself) or do I concentrate on simply working to get rid of my own up card?  There's a balance there, I think.  But, what do I know? I usually lose.  Give this game a try:  what have you got to lose?",positive,positive

"Barbie Fashionistas Doll #165, with Wheelchair & Long Blonde Hair Wearing Tropical Romper, Orange Shoes & Lemon Fanny Pack, Toy for Kids 3 to 8 Years Old",This is made so nice.

She loved it and the doll will be very well cared for with all her doctors and nurses she has. ha. Thanks so much. Linda,positive,positive
"LEGO Chain Reactions (Klutz Science/STEM Activity Kit), 9"" Length x 1.06"" Width x 10"" Height",Missing at least 2 pivotal pieces to create any of the projects in the book.

Melissa & Doug Scoop and Stack Ice Cream Cone Magnetic Pretend Play Set,"Really disappointed. I have probably 20 melissa and doug toys for my kids. I love the brand and would rate all their other toys as 5 stars. This one though is really frustrating. As many have noted, the magnets in the scoops are way too weak. You can stack multiple scoops, but if you try to pick up the cone, they all fall off. Forget carrying the cone. Even as an adult, I cannot carry a cone with more than 1 scoop even if I try to be s steady as possible. The set is adorable and I would give it 5 stars if they fixed this issue. As it is, I wish I had never bought it. Other reviewers had noted the magnet issue, but it is much worse than I anticipated.",negative,negative
Melissa & Doug Slice and Bake Wooden Cookie Play Food Set,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 2 year old niece and she LOVED it!! She chose this gift out of ALL her gifts to play with first and kept her occupied for hours. Her 5 year old brother also joined in the cookie making fun! I highly recommend this if you are thinking of buying. Very well made/sturdy wood- looks like a very expensive toy (including the packaging). You won’t be disappointed and neither will the kiddos.,positive,positive
"Bicycle Standard Face Playing Cards, 2 Piece","The cards feel like a cheap, slick plastic material and they don't shuffle well. These were more expensive than other options and I was expecting the typical, high quality cards you normally get from Bicycle. Very disappointed and we'll now be looking for another deck of cards. And if you haven't read it already, the review on these cards about playing gold fish and Dumbledore is hilarious! A must read.",negative,negative

Relationship Deck by BestSelf ― 150 Discussion Prompts for Real Relationship Conversations ― Relationship Cards for Deeper Connection and Better Love,"I bought this for my husband & I. Date nights aren't what they used to be and we run out of things to talk about besides work. These cards are really helping. Some cards really do ask uncomfortable questions, which is a good thing because being vulnerable with your partner is important. It keeps things from getting stale. I highly recommend these & will likely buy them as gifts for my sisters and their boyfriends.",positive,positive

Tamagotchi Hello Kitty (42892),"This product is cute ( although tiny) but the tamagotchi keeps glitching. Despite taking care of it, when we go to feed it it makes a loud beep and goes back to the clock setting and there’s no way to get out Of it other than resetting the clock. Once you reset the clock, the Tamagotchi turns back into an egg and starts all over again. This has happened several times, I even returned the first one  I got and it happened again with the new one.",negative,negative

"Tru-Ray Construction Paper P103031, 10 Classic Colors, 9"" x 12"", 50 Sheets","I bought this pack of paper specifically for brown and pink. Unfortunately their version of brown is a lighter black with a little more warmth to it. Absolutely not brown at all. If you’re like me and want a nice rich chocolate brown, pass on this one. The center of the sunflower I posted a pic of is made with the brown. I honestly don’t see brown. What I do like is the weight of this paper. It doesn’t curl as much as other papers when glue is applied. I really like it. Projects look great.",positive,positive

"URSKYTOUS 60Pcs Animal Pencil Erasers Bulk Kids Japanese Come Apart Puzzle Eraser Toys for Party Favors, Classroom Prizes, Carnival Gifts and School Supplies(Random Designs)",I got these little erasers as gift for Halloween.  They were perfect. They were individually wrapped and none were bigger than my thumb (I do have small hands). Most fit in an average size Easter egg.  They're kind of like puzzles as they come apart into pieces but make up cute colorful animals. I'd by them again for birthdays and give away prizes.,positive,positive

Funko Disney The Haunted Mansion - Call of The Spirits: Magic Kingdom Park Edition Game,"I’m a huge Disney Parks fan, and have been looking forward to the release of a proper Haunted Mansion board game, especially since it was designed by the same company that worked on Villainous. I was initially worried the game would be too simple and not that replayable, but I was wrong! While it’s still definitely simple, we played four games after opening the box and still wanted to play more! The instructions are very easy to understand, and get you playing quickly. The games aren’t very long, so it’s easy to start another game. Because of how simple and easy to learn it is, it’s a great game to break out for a game night with new players, unlike how Villainous takes a few games in order to get a grasp on the rules. I highly recommend this game!",positive,positive

Hasbro Gaming Guess Who? Game Original Guessing Game for Kids Ages 6 and Up for 2 Players,Great game but a little flimsy. Cards were a little hard to get into their game space and they fall out easy.

Battat – Farmers Market Basket – Toy Kitchen Accessories – Pretend Cutting Play Food Set for Toddlers 3 Years + (37-Pcs),"My almost 2-year-old loves this set. Enjoys pulling the foods apart, “feeding” them to her baby doll and stuffed animals, and putting them in pots and pans and wherever else. She also really really really loves the knives, not to cut the food with, but to hold and play with. Would have held back the knives til she’s older had I known how she’d be using them now. Hoping she learns to cut the food with them, sure that’ll happen with time and it’ll be a good skill for her. This has been a great way to teach her the names of a bunch of fruits and vegetables, and the toys themselves are really lightweight and easy to hold and play with. Also love the basket - great way to keep the food organized and to teach my toddler how to clean up (put them in the basket) when we’re done playing. Highly recommend!",positive,positive
Barbie Club Chelsea Camper,"This was a special prize picked out by my daughter for meeting a health milestone. We even printed out a picture of it so she could look at it!

Tamagotchi Pix - Floral (Pink) (42901),"The media could not be loaded. It came in perfect condition, it works super well and is very responsive. The box came in great condition, its only messed up by me opening it. Small scatches are only noticeable with flash, most likely from rubbing against clothing. But no need to shine flash on it. I can't wait for the green one to come out",positive,positive

"Exploding Kittens - A Russian Roulette Card Game, Easy Family-Friendly Party Games - Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids - 2-5 Players","One might think, upon first inspection, that there is way too much packaging material for a mere 20 cards to expand one's Exploding Kittens core game. However, upon opening the box, one would discover that not only are there the expected 20 brand new cards, illustrated by the Oatmeal, but also a plastic divider and.... no drumroll, please (you'll scare the kitties)... a Human Cone of Shame! ""What in the name of the Oatmeal's Holy Name would you do with a Human Cone of Shame?"" one might ask. I'm glad one asked! One would have to wear it until the end of the game if one forgot it was their turn to play! The Imploding Kitten card is diabolical. When drawn, it must be put back in the deck, face up, and the next person to draw it is out of the game, period. No Defuse card may be played, and it cannot be noped. Suddenly, that Shuffle card you drew three rounds ago just became a lot more important, didn't it? The ability to reverse the order of play, a la Uno, also adds a new twist. As always, the cards are beautifully done. The game remains a pleasure to play, as I do often with my work friends during lunch. As long as Exploding Kittens keeps putting out new expansions, I plan to buy them.",positive,positive

"Seckton Upgrade Kids Selfie Camera, Christmas Birthday Gifts for Girls Age 3-9, HD Digital Video Cameras for Toddler, Portable Toy for 3 4 5 6 7 8 Year Old Girl with 32GB SD Card-Pink","Purchased this for my 3 y/o, and he loved it!  He likes taking pictures and messing around with the built-in games.  That being said, I’ve had to return it TWICE due to the battery no longer holding a charge.  The first time was after a day, the second time was after two weeks.  In both cases, I’m using the supplied charging cable and a standard USB wall charger (not included).  The unit shows 100% battery charged when plugged in, and actually will turn on while plugged in.  However as soon as you remove the cable, it’s gone.  This immediately points to the battery no longer working.  I guess I’ll try again using another generic Chinese company, and maybe their batteries will be somewhat better.  My kid loves this camera too much for me not to have it, but beware if you buy it, it probably won’t last long.",negative,negative

She loves the wallet with  the fake money that looks mighty real by the way!!! The credit cards are awesome because they look real and even have the indents on the numbers. The makeup is fake but she can’t tell, she still puts it on. Like another reviewer said it would have been great to have the phone light up and have sounds, maybe even buttons to press. The purse has not ripped yet like other reviews, but I will update if a problem arises The purse opening is kind of small but it’s perfect for her!",positive,positive

However, when my package arrived and I opened the box, the game box was damaged and inside looked like someone took the box and shook it like crazy. It was not in shrink wrap, and one of the flaps on the box was actually torn. So it was damaged inside of the well packed Amazon box that contained other undamaged items. The pieces all still work, so I’ll be able to play the game, however it was disappointing to open a damaged product.",negative,negative

That one has worked for years.  We were able to use the calculator exactly twice.  After that none of the buttons did anything.  Just a 0 on the screen.  And the force that the draw comes out when you press the open button would give someone whiplash.  I've never returned anything so quickly.  Total junk.",negative,negative

We had about 14 very energetic 4 year olds that were running all over the place. I ordered 2 kits to ensure I had enough for all the kids. This kit was a life saver. I was able to wrangle all 14 at a table and demonstrate how to probably use the chisel and then I set them loose. All the kids loved digging in the egg and slowly uncovering the dinosaur inside. It took about 15-25 minutes for them to completely dig it out, which was a quick relief for the parents! Haha! I would recommend these for any birthday or kid activity!",positive,positive

She is able to do it all on her own which gives her a great sense of accomplishment. She has started to pick out the words when we are reading books.

Hasbro Gaming Trouble Board Game for Kids Ages 5 and Up 2-4 Players,"I can't give it one star, because sure, it's fine for the money. I wish there was a better quality version available for a bit more, however. I would be happy to pay an extra $5-$10 for one that comes in a decent box, has an actual container for the pieces, and has a dice bubble that doesn't chip with every use.

Ticket to Ride Board Game | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Train Game | Ages 8+ | For 2 to 5 players | Average Playtime 30-60 minutes | Made by Days of Wonder,"What is not to love about this game? The rules are fairly simple and easy to follow. The set up is very easy and quick. The game play needs you to think and put some thought into your strategy. It is quick and easy to learn and younger children can probably pick up the point of the game quickly. We played with an 11 year old but a smart kid who is 9 or 10 could easily play with no problems I believe. Do you use your pieces to block other players? Do you start to lay down track just anywhere because it might help you in the future? Do you take extra route pieces because then you can pick and choose your routes? How do you use your turn because you can only do one thing- draw cards, play cards to make a route, a pick new route cards? My youngest, age nine, who is a get up and go full of energy kid, enjoyed playing this game with the family. It is not a short game (It took us about an hour to play our first game but the time in play has decreased to about 30 minutes or 45 minutes now). Lots of fun. Well worth the money. Enjoy.",positive,positive

The straps came off the dresses and the velcro was coming off other pieces. The ball gowns don't stay up because they are not tight enough to stay up. My girls are 8 and 10 and not too hard on things. These are cheap and poorly made. The company should not be allowed to sell these in the U.S.",negative,negative

These were the best ones I encountered, with strong velcro and big pieces.

Grandpa and I had fun playing with them before wrapping.  They are fun and easy to operate.  I wish the packaging was more inclusive of an older child .. we took them out of the box so the kids wouldn’t be turned off by the toddler pictures and the 3+ age suggestion.  We think they will be a big hit on Christmas Day .. with our adult children wanting to try their hand at “driving”.  We were puzzled by the four figures that came with it, since two would do the job just fine.  A fun toy without a mega investment.  The two frequencies are a great idea, so they can both be used at the same time. Update ... they were a dud as far as our grandchildren were concerned..  Gave them to my neighbor whose younger grandchildren were more than delighted with them.  She also commented on how sturdy they are!",positive,positive

First they are difficult to remove from the paper. The puffy part from the sticker comes off the adhesive the minute you remove it from any surface & sometimes even straight from the original packaging paper. I have double the mess around the house! I thought it was because of my toddler, but I tried removing it myself and the same thing happened! Awful quality. Don't buy! I'd give it 0 stars if I could!",negative,negative

"Monopoly Junior Board Game, Ages 5 and up (Amazon Exclusive)","My littlest has been struggling with math and counting and this playful approach has proved so helpful. She’s 5 and while she needs help reading the ‘chance’ cards, her overall comprehension from numbers 0-30 has gone up in a short time. The ‘money’ is all $1 dollar bills, and the limited spaces means you’re going around the board rather quickly. Instead of houses and houses, you just have ownership over property. It really is a very basic game of monopoly and a great introduction to games and strategy. Also, not a lot of “bad” things happen (turns lost/owing money/ending up in jail etc) and from what I see at her age, it’s a really good approach to encourage positive engagement without much confusion.",positive,positive

Disney Princess Dress Up Trunk Deluxe 21 Piece [Amazon Exclusive],"Our almost 4 yr old loves it. We got it for her for Christmas this year, so we shall see how long the thrill lasts. She is a bit of a tomboy/not so in to the Princess scene (fine by me), so I didn't want to spend a fortune on a full Princess wardrobe. This was perfect, in my book.  You get what you pay for though & I worry that the fabric/seams won't hold up for long. I will update this if there are issues later.  Still, a great buy for a little girl who wants to be a warrior Princess!",positive,positive

They typically all get smooshed into one big blob of color anyway. I like to buy these bigger sets and ration them out over time so they don't get all used up or mixed up right away.

"Crayola Fine Line Markers Adult Coloring Set, Kids Indoor Activities At Home, Gift, 40 Count",Nice markers with a good selection of colors. The fine line tip isn't very fine compared with the Sharpie ultra-fine which I prefer. It's difficult to lay down the ink smoothly - lots of streaking. You can't color back and forth because it's so wet that the paper starts to ball up. I used single one-way strokes but the ink still streaks. The colors are brilliant with a nice range. I'd like to see markers with these colors that went down as smoothly as the Sharpie Ultra-Fine do.,neutral,neutral

"Barbie Doll Mermaid with Light-up Tail! [Amazon Exclusive] , Blonde","Love this mermaid barbie!  This is my 4 year olds new favorite bath toy.  She loves mermaids and dolls in general, and this barbie covers both of those.  She loves the lights and her tail. I do wish her crown stayed on better.  It came with two tags holding the crown on her, and I decided not to clip them so that the crown would stay on her.  But even with the tags holding the crown to her head, it still moves around. I am also worried about the water sensors on her back and if they will erode eventually.  I'm making sure that after every bath she gets set out to dry well in hopes that it will keep her in working order.  So far so good, but she's only had it for a week. Overall this is a very fun Barbie doll especially if your little likes mermaids.",positive,positive

I love that they are learning ways to think about building, thinking creatively, and using their hands to create. The magnets are also great because it is easy for my youngest child (who is 2) to build things as well. This most recent purchase was a gift for my niece for her next birthday!",positive,positive

Infantino Press & Stay Sensory Blocks,"My baby loves to scoot these blocks across our tile floors because their hard plastic makes a loud noise that he finds amusing.

"eKids Frozen Sing Along Boom Box Speaker with Microphone for Fans of Frozen Toys for Girls, Kids Karaoke Machine with Built in Music and Flashing Lights , Blue",Bought this for my daughters second birthday. I read all the other reviews and I was a little concerned but I think the sound quality is great. The song and microphone come through pretty clear I mean it’s a toy people let’s remember we’re not buying some state of the art recording gear. The volume control is good too I mean the loud is really really loud but the low is decent and doesn’t give me a headache like a lot of her other toys. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is that it only plays one song. It does have other movie quotes but hearing the same song over and over and over again is kinda making me crazy. Doesn’t seem to bother her one bit though and she loves the light show on it too. Overall good buy and would recommend.,positive,positive
Toysmith My Sweet Baby Magic Baby Bottles,"OMG...I remember having these types of bottles for my babies when I was little.  I absolutely loved them and was mystified by the disappearing liquid.  Those memories inspired me to get these for two little girls, who were about 2 years old, along with the Melissa and Doug Jenna 12"" Dolls.  Almost a year later, and the parents tell us how those dolls and those bottles are their little girls fave things.  Sometimes, fond memories of our childhood guide us in the right direction.  ♥",positive,positive

It steers you toward an app instead.  This may not be a deal breaker for some, but we usually love the screen free experience lego offers.  The PDF of the directions exists...but it is too large for us to print.  Seems chippy not to include it with the set.  I reached out to the company but there has been no response.  Our first negative experience with LEGO.",negative,negative

Casdon Dyson Ball | Miniature Dyson Ball Replica For Children Aged 3+ | Features Working Suction To Add Excitement To Playtime,"My daughter LOVES this vacuum. It looks exactly like our Dyson (minus color) and every time we vacuum she picks up her vacuum to help out. The design is great and she loves turning it ""on"" so the little colorful balls move around in the canister. You can actually turn this on so that there is suction-- but don't hope for too much. The suction area is small and the reservoir for dirt, dust, etc. is tiny. BUT -- you're not buying a trie vacuum, so I don't think that should detract anyone from buying it. Let me tell you-- this thing is sturdy! This has been pushed over, dropped, etc. and it still works wonderfully. She can sometimes get a little rough with it-- but nothing that has affected how it works. This is what I was a bit worried about but this vacuum has proven to be up to the toddler challenge. Highly recommend this!",positive,positive

Hanes Men's Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt Value Pack (4-pack),"These are definitely NOT comfort soft as advertised. My husband has been getting Hanes for years and we made the mistake of ordering them here because we found a good deal. Well, you get what you pay for..these must be a knock off or something. They were rough and itch even AFTER a wash. When we got them we realized there was no way they were true Hanes shirts. We submitted a return request but the seller was going to charge a 20% restocking fee and we had to pay for shipping so beware prior to buying. We tried washing a couple times to see if they would get any better but no luck. So we are now using as cleaning rags. So if you’re okay with low quality itchy and rough undershirts, then buy these!",negative,negative
Tamagotchi Pix - Floral (Pink) (42901),"Bought 2. Battery life is horrible. Should have options to be able to plugged in, since this constantly uses batteries. The pixel needs upgrading.

We were having to watch our daughter closely when she would start playing babies because she would try to go to the sink and get a cup of water to let her baby ""drink"", but with these magic bottles, we don't have to worry about big spills and such anymore!  Great baby doll bottles.  Definately reccommend for all the ""little mommies"" out there!",positive,positive

Jenga Game Wooden Blocks Stacking Tumbling Tower Kids Game Ages 6 and Up (Amazon Exclusive),"This is the calssic Jenga and is great fun, and works perfectly to play and practice your dexterity.  My one (admittedly small) gripe comes in with the method of restacking the planks.  I believe the old versions had a tw0-sided rigid clear plastic mold that you could pack the planks into, in order to create a tower in a relatively short period of time.  This mold is much more flexible, almost to the point of being useless.  It helps to approximate the planks, but it isn't rigid enough to hold them in place while you attempt to setup the tower.  It will work, but you have to be much more careful while using it.  I wouldn't avoid this item because of it, and I only have this compaint because I remember what the old class models had.  Don't avoid buying it because of that, though.  It stills plays great.",positive,positive

"2 Pack Cartoon Remote Control Cars - Police Car and Race Car - Radio Control Toys for Kids, Boys, & Girls - Each with Different Frequencies So Both Can Race Together - Gifts for Toddler Boys Ages 2-4","Gave these to my 18 month old grandson for xmas. He and his parents are in love with them. They are w/holding the remotes for now because too difficult for the boy to use - yet - but meanwhile said they are his favorite toy. He plays all day pushing them, and, what they discovered is unique, the cars will move all on their own which generates hysteria by all. Daughter figures the cars must be sensitive to some waves and when a car drives by, or something that triggers the remote type wave, the cars move on their own. Doubtful the mfg means for that to happen, by this small family thinks it's the greatest fun of all toys. I'm so happy that they love them.

Jenga Game Wooden Blocks Stacking Tumbling Tower Kids Game Ages 6 and Up (Amazon Exclusive),"I’m honestly disappointed at the quality of the blocks as well as the reconstruction support. Unlike the traditional jenga blocks base of hard wood that can withstand the abuse of the game, the blocks in this set are very soft wood. Some of them aren’t even well finished (see pic)! Right away, some of the blocks are already warped and don’t sit flat. The cardboard they give you to help rebuild the tower is extremely flimsy - it’s just a single thin layer of card stock. I expected more for a classic game that families should be able enjoy for years, not months (based on how quickly and likely they’re to be warped, dinged and dented out of shape).",negative,negative
Fisher-Price See ‘n Say the Farmer Says [Amazon Exclusive],"I as well as many others let nostalgia take over and didn't read reviews..  Amazon Should be ashamed making this an amazon Choice product which helped me hit the purchase button faster, now I have to be aware of there recommendations as this product is Absolutely horrible.  Anyone who can say something positive obviously does not have learning as serving for there child.. As people stated this does not work or even resemble the ORIGINAL, I'm not old but mine had a pull cord and I still remember it to this day and it made the noise of the animal it landed on to teach you something, not this one it makes noise of the last one, I immediately noticed this and said who thinks this is teaching! It would only confuse a childs ability to learn, like I want my son when I say whats dog say and he moo's like a cow to be his response.  Way to ruin a good toy Fisher Price..  If that's not enough it's smaller than a dinner plate ""original was huge"" and  the lever is hard to pull for small children..  So if you like wasting $25.00 do yourself a favor and  please send to local children's hospital or something instead of this riduculously backwards, tiny non-teaching Mini Toy...  Thanks for ruining my memory of this awesome toy Fisher Price for the next 45 years of my life I will not be reminiscing of the toy I had but instead this sorry piece of plastic junk...",negative,negative

They fit all the Chelsea dolls (Barbies are too big so they wont fit) and roll extremely smoothly. The unicorn tail end of the car is very cute and adds the finishing touch to the overall theme. Chelsea does have a unicorn ice cream shirt and skirt on and comes with a puppy and stickers. Overall, very cute set for a special little kid who loves dolls.",positive,positive

She really enjoys holding them up so I can tell her the names of the fruit, putting them in baskets (at random at this point, but still fun!), and stacking the baskets. Or wearing them on her head, haha. I just have to try and pick them up in between playing with them or little plastic fruit and veggies end up all over my house.",positive,positive

"Ocean Sea Animal, 52 Pack Assorted Mini Vinyl Plastic Animal Toy Set, Funcorn Toys Realistic Under The Sea Life Figure Bath Toy for Child Educational Party Cake Cupcake Topper,Valentines Day Gift","I bought this set for my toddler who is 2. He loves animals so I thought it would be nice to introduce him to some sea animals. The pieces are not big and are perfect for small fingers such as toddlers. I do not recommend these animals for babies because of the size. None of the animals have a little hole so no water can accumulate. This was really important to me because my son loves playing with toys in the water. There are MANY sea animals included with the set such as: octopus, dolphins, whales, sharks, sea slug, sea snails, penguin, sea lion, seal, walrus, crab, star fish, squid, sea horses, etc. I would recommended this to any parent that wants to introduce their child to sea creatures. My TWO year old knows the difference between a sea lion, walrus, and seal! I love this purchase.",positive,positive

Got2Glow Fairy Finder - Electronic Fairy Jar Catches Virtual Fairies - Got to Glow (Pink),"I really thought I would love this toy for my 4 year old, so I paid the higher price tag they stuck on this around Christmas time of $50… She’s super into fairies right now & this looked adorable for a smaller child. Well, it was a huge disappointment. She just caught the same 4 fairies over & over and got super frustrated over this. The buttons & games where confusing even for me maybe because everything just ended up feeling pointless. Not even a 4 year old with their sense of whimsy & wonderment got a kick out of this one. I regret buying it 100%.",negative,negative

Disney Princess Dress Up Trunk Deluxe 21 Piece [Amazon Exclusive],"Really cute outfits, granddaughter plays with them non-stop. Quality is okay for playtime.

I have been having this figure for a year and it has not broke! If you buy this figure then don’t treat it like a toy! Or it will break!",positive,positive

Cards Against Humanity,"I read the reviews, and I heard people say this was so fun.  The group of people I wanted to use this with includes two teens.  One of the reviews said they took out the cards that referred to God---one was""the blood of Christ""--2 referred to Jews in an antisemitic way, the rest were about sex mostly.  Well the idea is a great one but the authors must get their heads out of the can.  I decided to through it away",negative,negative
"Barbie Doll Mermaid with Light-up Tail! [Amazon Exclusive] , Blonde","I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday.  All she wanted was a light up, mermaid barbie.  She beamed when she opened it and loved it.  After a few times in the water it stopped working.  I unscrewed the battery compartment and black gunk was all over the batteries as well as the compartment.  The compartment is not a sealed one, so water leaks right through and corrodes/ruins the batteries.  The advertisement for this doll, specifically states to put it in the water.  Bad idea.  We now have a  mermaid that no longer lights up.",negative,negative

My daughter was able to make a mess and have a blast and all I had to do was wipe the floor and table (and her body) down with water and paper towels. It didn't even require soap. The paint is pretty cheap and came in very kid friendly containers. Super easy to use, the colors are pretty and the ""artist"" doesn't need to be super careful. I definitely recommend it.",positive,positive

Czech Games Codenames,I bought this for my sister's family and unfortunately found out they already had not only 1 but 2 copies of it! They love playing it and said that it's a fast game that you can play many times in a row and a great way to get to know people better. Update: We played the game (along with many others) for New Years Eve and it's a fun game. It definitely goes quick. We played it without using the timer but I can see why they have that as part of the game as some turns could just last forever when there's no time-crunch. They have an age limit of 10 years old minimum and I can understand why. It requires some very creative thinking for how to connect multiple words both to come up with them as well as try to guess what your partner meant. You may be able to change the rules for under 10 and only try to get your opponent to guess one agent at a time,positive,positive

Hanes Men's Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt Value Pack (4-pack),"I ordered another Hanes t-shirt bundle from another page and those feel better than these. These shirts are not soft at all. They are suppose to be cotton but they must be cheap short fiber cotton that feels slightly scratchy. After washing them, I have to use my lint roller to remove the hair (my hair & my dogs hair) that sticks to them. I thought it would be nice to have a lot of t-shirts but you pay for what you get. Maybe in 10 yrs, they will soften up. I'll keep washing them and hope for the best. PS, Im a woman.",negative,negative

"Fisher-Price Little People Friends & Pets Figure Pack, Set of 7 Character Figures for Toddlers and Preschool Kids Ages 1 to 5 Years","This little group of characters is a great addition to our growing assortment of Little People toys.  The ones that specifically came with each set drift from one to another, so a few extras are always welcome.  Fisher-Price had a great idea when they made characters capable of fitting into any Little People set or toy—these are the same sturdy plastic with holes in the bottom.  They can attach to any toy that utilizes Little People figurines.  Our four year old likes this particular set, simply because it comes with a cute cat and dog.",positive,positive

They arrived frozen on my daughters birthday (-15* F outside) so I microwaved them individually for 15 seconds, enough so the kids could use them while they continued to thaw to the core. They work great. We have never used other cheaper products but I couldn’t ask for better and they met my expectations. The bottle is shaped well for little hands but it seems like it is a lot of paint and should last a while. The colors are really nice and work well for mixing. They’ve only used them a day and already have come up with some new and creative things they haven’t tried in other mediums. Overall I love this product!",positive,positive

Casdon Dyson Cord-Free Vacuum | Interactive Toy Dyson Vacuum For Children Aged 3+ | Includes Working Suction For Realistic Play,"This has been a godsend as my toddler insists on ""macuum"" every time I get out the real thing. She diligently vacuums by my side each time now! In fact, she gets upset when I stop, soo my floors have been extra clean since I got this. It barely sucks, but who cares? I'm not expecting her to actually clean (though it is really nice she wants to and is learning!) and this is not actually a Dyson. Also she sometimes leaves it on the ground next to it's place, so I've tripped on it a dozen times. I'm almost shocked it hasn't broken with my weight! Great purchase.",positive,positive

Mostly very well executed. However, the biggest problem is indeed a real problem. Unless I have a lamp that can sit in front of the register the solar panel does not get enough light to power the calculator. Not even with floor to ceiling windows in a bright room does this work. But if you put a lamp in front the register might tip over the lamp. The drawer does open forcefully as other reviewers have noted, but that's not a deal breaker for me. Not having a working calculator is problematic. However, my daughter loves it.",neutral,neutral

She likes that it will repeat some sentences that she has recorded, so it's like it is talking back to her.  The quality is a great value for the price of the robot.  It comes in different colors but she chose pink and the color is nice and vibrant.  The robot works as described and we have been having a lot of fun playing with it.

"Educational Insights BrainBolt Brain Teaser Memory Game, Giftr for Kids, Teens & Adults, Brain Game, Ages 7 to 107",I bought this product for my dad (who's primary language is Spanish) to practice for his memory which is absolutely loves to use. Pros - Easy to use [can be used by everyone regardless of language] Primary play is the use of lights for memory Instructions are in multiple languages which can even be used here as a pdf Cons - Demo/play button is really unneeded to have and can cause confusion Front-facing buttons for play is a bit much,positive,positive
"Pressman Charades for Kids -- The 'No Reading Required' Family Game, 5""","We love charades and thought this would be a fun game for our three grandchildren, ages 4 to 7. It's easy enough to play. Non-readers just look at the picture and act it out. Readers can use the word descriptions. It's just hard for any of the players to actually guess the right answer, especially if the actor is a young child. So my g'kids lost interest pretty quickly.  Even the smartest little kids can have trouble really acting out a word in such a way that the other players really know what they are doing. For example, ""backpack"" resulted in a 6 year old child just pointing to his back repeatedly. So there were a lot of wrong guesses, or no guesses!  Many of the clues tend to get acted out the same: a broom, a hoe, etc. On the plus side, it's fun that all players take a turn trying to guess the mystery word, until one person gets it right and wins that card. This is more fun and engaging than choosing teams and just watching while the other team take their turn playing. And kids do have fun when it's their turn to act out a word. We just found it got old quickly for the ones watching! I think we'll put this on the shelf and give it a try in another couple of years.",neutral,neutral
Catan Board Game (Base Game) | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Adventure Board Game | Ages 10+ | for 3 to 4 Players | Average Playtime 60 Minutes | Made by Catan Studio,"This is the base game.  I can't emphasize that enough.  This review will only handle the base game, minus expansions. LEARNING CURVE:  This game is extraordinarily simple and straightforward to learn.  Played once through, it makes plenty of sense and opens doors to more complex rules and gameplay. GAME SPEED:  1-2 hours for 4 players.  Game moves briskly but with obvious early-, mid-, and end-game stages that each have their own strategies and approaches.  Game easily resumed from a paused state if you take a break. GAMEPLAY OVERALL:  Catan is satisfying to play, even more satisfying to win.  As a game best played with a poker face and a good set of bluffing skills, Catan rewards long-term foresight and strategies more than rushed or brute-forced gameplay techniques.  Catan can become repetitive IF and ONLY IF you refuse to play randomly.  I highly recommend players who have a few games under their belt learn to completely randomize the map, starting positions, and resource entitlement for more satisfying experiences. APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS?  Depends on your child.  Children with a knack for puzzles and strategy games will find playing Catan with adults to be very rewarding.  Probably a bit too complex for children to play with each other, however; too many ""honor system"" concepts in play, too easy to cheat each other. APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIAL NEEDS?  Gameplay can easily be catered for adults or children with special needs.  Game rules are insanely simple and easily modified for those wanting additional assistance.  Communities online for adapting Catan gameplay are prevalent and easily found. CONCLUSION:  Catan is a fantastically easy game to pick up and learn, but complex and difficult to master.  Catan is a game best suited to be expanded and enhanced, as the base game is truly just the first step into the world of Catan.",positive,positive

"Hatchimals Pixies, Crystal Flyers Starlight Idol Magical Flying Pixie Toy with Lights, Kids Toys for Girls Ages 6 and up","My daughter loves this fairy. It’s a big ball of anxiety for my husband, dogs, and me. For some reason I assumed it would be like other flying toys and sense a wall before nose-diving into it. This thing is loud and comes at you like a giant bug. It hurts when it crashes into you. My poor dog yelped when it hit her in the face. The wings have broken off, but we’ve managed to clip them back on again. It worries me that something in my house is going to break, or this fairy will get stuck in my daughter’s hair.

Melissa & Doug Food Groups - 21 Wooden Pieces and 4 Crates,"These pretend food products are made of wood which is good for sturdiness and somewhat nostalgic, but my sweet 2-yr-old grdghtr regards the round items as ""balls"" and occasionally throws them, which is not good for many reasons. I can teach her not to do this, but even dropping some of the heavier items on a ceramic tile floor (my kitchen) could possibly cause tiles to have hairline cracks.  Otherwise, it's a generous and colorful assortment. Also did not realize the 4 boxes are wood as well.  Did not have a use for them in her current play--1 or more large plastic jars with lids or her FP shoppind cart are better for storage.  Love the quality of Melissa&Doug toys.",positive,positive
"Funko Five Nights at Freddy's Articulated Foxy Action Figure, 5""","This dude broke almost immediately after getting him out of the package. A piece of the right shoulder housing snapped off making it impossible to attach the right arm at all. My daughter had a foxy toy years ago with similar issues. The head was very wobbly and the nose popped off, shoulder and arm joints broke. The right ear on the spring trap that came with foxy is already about to come off completely and we haven’t even used it. I think that this is probably more of a manufacturing issue than anything else or perhaps they’ve been sitting in a hot warehouse for years. Seems like it’s a gamble on whether or not you’re going to get a good one.",negative,negative

A friend bought it for me for Christmas during the pandemic. I had 5 people in my family at the time and figured that it was a way we could all play. My family is now back down to 4 and we love this game. my husband is not a big fan of board games, although he does like Life, but he liked this game. My 8 year old was able to play it fairly easily, so it's a win all the way around. I really like it. It's a little hard to keep track of points on the board, but I am going to try to put it on paper instead and that might work better. Fully recommend.",positive,positive

"Fisher-Price Little People Friends & Pets Figure Pack, Set of 7 Character Figures for Toddlers and Preschool Kids Ages 1 to 5 Years","This set is what I would call a ""filler"" set, but not in a bad way. This set fills in the gaps where your themed sets might be lacking. There are more people than animals here, so it bulks up a child's choices when playing with a play set. I also like that it includes different people of color to expose a child to the fact that people have differences and that that's okay! The build quality is what is expected from the Little People family and these will be a great addition to playtime!",positive,positive

I had her keep the ring box though, just in case she wanted to change her mind. I would recommend them for little girls! Very nice!",positive,positive

The only bummer about these is so much plastic packaging (each sticker page comes individually wrapped in a plastic sleeve) but I will admit those plastic sleeves really help them to be more portable without getting messed up.",positive,positive

In addition, my daughter brought it outside to play and left a piece outside before some rain, so the paint is slightly chipping off of that slice.

Hygge Games ...I should have known that! Trivia Game Green,"Two things you need to know. The first is that this is basically just a set of trivia questions on cards. As such, if I owned a bar, it's the sort of thing I might put in batches on tables or something. Second, they are of pretty uniform difficulty. They tend to be geared to adults (thanks to the dating on some of the questions)--perhaps folks in their 30s? But they are pretty easy to answer among those in such a group. Maybe they would be more challenging if you were drunk? But a game where you know all but one or two of the answers doesn't end up much fun. Basically, these are about 70% of where the standard Trivial Pursuits deck is. If TP is too hard for you, this would be a nice alternative set of questions. There wasn't much value for the money from my perspective.",negative,negative
"Hasbro Gaming Candy Land Kingdom Of Sweet Adventures Board Game For Kids Ages 3 & Up (Amazon Exclusive), Red","This is such a great first game for smaller children! It allows young ones to practice game skills like good sportsmanship and taking turns, while encouraging counting.

Success in the game depends on chance not strategy. This means losing is never linked to personal choice or ability.

They are annoying. They are everything in between depending on how much your children ask for help and argue between them on who has more/less than the other. It's either a break from your kids, or an all out war where you are required to play referee.  Good luck. Not recommended for super young children, or bare feet.",neutral,neutral

"CoComelon Interactive Learning JJ Doll with Lights, Sounds, and Music to Encourage Letter, Number, and Color Recognition, by Just Play","There are a few key differences to the actual item pictures and the doll received. I ordered mine shipped and sold from Amazon and not a third party seller. The doll comes in plastic although BJ’s and other retailers do sell it in a  box. The font on the feet are different and the placement of the letters/numbers are different. The alphabet block is a completely different shade of blue (it’s not just the lighting). The (iris) brown in the eyes do not sit above the lid but are smaller floating circles. The picture shows a wide stomach, while the doll I received has the stomach sewn in quite tightly. The red on the cheeks sits much lower and the dolls head looks square as opposed to the more proportion rounder faced doll shown. Lastly and most importantly, the voice of the doll is not JJ’s. Anyone who is buying this for their kid has likely endure endless hours of cocomelon, enough to distinguished that voice. We have purchased the Bedtime JJ doll and the Preschool version and the voice on this doll and can confirm the voice on this roll does not even match the other toys. Ours did come with batteries and the buttons function the songs however aren’t Cocomelon songs just a random kids voice singing the ABC’s. Not sure if it’s worth buying but if you read this review you’ll at least know what you’re actually paying for. The first two pictures show what was received and the last is how the item looks on BJs and other websites.",negative,negative

Bicycle Dice 10 Pack,Nice dice great package.  If I measured correctly these are 10mm size dice which I believe is a bit smaller than the standard size of 11mm.

"Crayola Ultra Clean Washable Markers, Broad Line Markers, Gifts, 40 Classic Colors",I returned these after one use.  A lot of the markers were dried up and didn't color well.  Though I did have the right number of different colors in the box - a lot of the colors came out so similar to other colors that they may as well have been a duplicate of another color.  Other reviews showed pictures of the colored received- mine were definitely not like this in variation.  This is a very disappointing set.,negative,negative

What Do You Meme? Core Game - The Hilarious Adult Party Game for Meme Lovers,"First time at a lunch gathering meeting new people (white conservative family). I bought this as an ice breaker. I was not disappointed. Even the dad was having fun with these cards. The mature ones come separate in case you'd like to skip them. They are very mature indeed. I was scared at first but glad I got them. Very enjoyable. 2nd time playing it at another Thanksgiving gathering this time with Hispanic liberals. Two rounds in and they decided to have one person pick the picture to meme, one person (with the least accent 🤣 to read - that was me) and we all voted on the funniest meme. They created a democracy 🤦‍♀️. It was very fun the second time around. Played for 2 hours and still have not gone through all of the cards and the pictures. Very dirty cards 🤪",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Wooden Pizza Play Food Set With 36 Toppings,"The pizza, pan, spatula, and pizza cutter are all as good as the other Melissa and Doug kitchen and food toys, which is to say they are fantastic. That being said my only complaint is about the size of the pepper, pepperoni, and mushroom topping pieces. Yes, they are a bit on the small side; if you took 4 quarters and stacked them atop each other you would have a rough approximation of the height and width. As such, yes, they are a choking hazard for smaller children or swallowing hazard for children who like to pop everything in their mouths. The other issue with them, though is that you find them everywhere. The box just does not contain them very well, and, as such, they get spilled a lot during play. This isn't a deal breaker, but it would be nice to see them come up with a better design for the Pizza Party box so it corrals the pieces better.",positive,positive

The instructions could be better, when you scan the app, it does not do 3D rendering of the pieces like some other set do. No zooming in and out or rotating, just page by page scrolling, the same as the manual. So it makes it little harder to put together and since it’s more expensive, I would expect that feature to integrated into the app for this product.",positive,positive

Hasbro Gaming Bop It! Micro Series Game,I wasn't sure about this because  of the size and what all it could do. but it's very bare basics. if you don't know the Original size had Easter eggs and I doubt think this one does if so I can't figure it out. but it has two volumes and doesn't get too Loud. and it's not just single player it has pass it so has many as you want to play can. one thing to keep in mind if you switch player mode it  Erase the top score each time which is annoying  because  I had got pretty  high and than lost it. but I would definitely  recommend  it for travelers or if your downsizing  and still want to have a fun 90's pass time but don't wanna waste space that's  why I got it.

Melissa & Doug Cutting Fruit Set - Wooden Play Food Kitchen Accessory,I love that Melissa and Doug give us alternatives to plastic toys. My 4 year-old son loves to help in the kitchen and had been begging to cut food so I was so excited when I came across this. Now he has his own food he can safely cut and serve. The food is well made. It’s nice that it comes in it’s own crate so you have somewhere to store it. It has Velcro that holds the pieces together. We all know that Velcro breaks down over time so that’s my only concern. Only time will tell.  I would highly recommend it.,positive,positive

The smell everyone complains of is really bad. I had a headache within an hour of opening it. My nose also got stuffed up and I got sick to my stomach. My 4yo said “she can feel the smell in her throat”. Awful. Just awful. We left it outside in 50 degrees weather in hopes the smell will wear out. It didn’t it. I 100% do not recommend.

Hanes Men's Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt Value Pack (4-pack),"I was apprehensive about buying these because they have the tag on them. But Hanes must use special thread because the tags don't scratch at all. I most appreciate that these T-shirts have NO POLYESTER or other synthetics in them. They're also a very thick, quality weave. Since I wear a T-shirt for one day before tossing it in the laundry, these have already gotten quite a few washes, dry-wrings, and (usually) line dries. They've held up very nicely. There's no piling yet--not even in the high-friction underarms region. And they're so comfortable I leave them on when I get home from work until bedtime. I didn't used to pay attention to the fabric mix of my T-shirts until, annoyed, I realized I kept having to replace them often. Sure enough, they were either mixed (poly/cotton) or even all poly. Never again.. Another benefit of pure cotton is it washes very easily and releases dirt quickly. Poly-mix T-shirts (at least mine) never come out fully clean. These Hanes T-shirts have earned their way into our household staples and I'm sure I'll be buying quite a lot more--especially given the unbeatable price.",positive,positive
Hasbro Gaming: Jenga Classic Game,"My kids got this game for Christmas and it’s a fun game to play as a family. However, my children much prefer to play crash the tower than Jenna.

Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza,"This is a simple card game. All the cards are distributed evenly among the players. Each player, in turn, says the next word in the sequence (taco, cat, goat, cheese, pizza) and flips the top card of their deck onto a pile in the middle of the players. If the card matches the word, everyone slams their hand onto the pile; the last one to get their hand in place takes all the cards. There are three special cards (gorilla, narwhal, and groundhog) that require you to perform an action with your hands before slapping the pile. Again, the last person to slap the pile takes all the cards. If you flinch toward the pile or perform the wrong action for the special cards, you have to take the pile. The game ends when someone has no cards left in their deck and is first to slap the pile at the next opportunity. Pros: Easy to learn. You'll laugh a lot as you play it. The motions for the special cards are goofy. Families can play it together. Cons: Your hand *will* get slapped, and you might be scratched by fingernails. If you're playing with a competitive group, the likelihood of minor pain goes up. This game rewards players with sharp eyesight and fast reflexes. There is no strategy and not much replayability. The game is a decent value for the money, you can play it with kids, and it will be fun the first few times. After that, you're likely to leave this one on the shelf and only bring it out occasionally. And there's nothing wrong with that.",positive,positive

Disney Buzz Lightyear Interactive Talking Action Figure - 12 Inches,"This doesn't even deserve 1 star. So, my son received the interactive buzz for christmas. I decided to get one as a gift for one of his friends because his friend has woody and I thought he would like to have another so he could use the interactive feature. Well, I opened the box and immediately noticed that the buzz we received has the most evil look on his face, unlike the picture and one my son has(my sons looks like the picture on amazon). My sons came directly from a disney store and was packaged in a cardboard spaceship like in the movie. The toy i received 1.came in a wack ass box 2.has a totally different face 3.is NOT interactive 4.the blue button doesnt work 5. Has different character phrases 6. Has a cloudy helmet 7.has different ""try me"" stickers next to the buttons 8. The toy pictured on the back of the box looks like my sons that came directly from a Disney store, purchased in person but the buzz inside of that.box looks different. 9.has a different voice. I do not reccomend this toy and I honestly wonder of the seller is actually disney. Do not waste your money!",negative,negative

"Kinetic Sand Scents, Ice Cream Treats Playset with 3 Colors of All-Natural Scented Sand and 6 Serving Tools","I've bought the regular kinetic sand for awhile now because I loved how it wasn't a huge mess. This was the first colored set we tried and it's definitely a huge gross mess!!!! It crumbles and sticks to everything and after 10 minutes of play, we lost most the sand and it had hair all over in it(you can see a hairy cone from one of my pics)!! A tiny bit of the white got into the pink and once the colors touch there is no going back, I didn't even bother with getting out brown cause I could only imagine how gross that would look all mixed together. The topping peices are a huge CHOKING HAZZARD with any child that likes to put stuff in their mouth and it's the 1st thing my kid did. This stuff sticks to your hand and don't come off easy at all (see pics for details). This set should be more for teens or adults and I could see it being fun(hence any stars at all) but even then it wouldn't last long trying to keep colors separated. This is definitely not toddler or parent friendly and a waste of money because you won't get much play out of it.

Unfortunately, we had issues with products in the new recruit kit..the first thing we used was the invisible ink, and it doesn't work at all (seems to be dried out somehow, maybe old) And then he used his noise enhancer and loved it and then it easily broke, we aren't even sure how (cheaply made?).

Cards Against Humanity,"The game itself is horrible and vulgar, but of course I expected that. It can easily be made into a childrens game if a unprudish parent wanted to take the time to resort the cards and take out offensive ones. I ordered every pack I could find so that I would have enough to sort them to make an age appropriate game and save others just for the adults. Some cards were just so gross that they went in the trash, but that's ok. What is not ok is the disgusting beat up box that Amazon sent me. It was supposed to be new. It looked and felt like the box was rotted. The outside plastic was filthy. I didn't get a picture of that before I opened it. I can't return it because I bought it to play at Christmas and the new year. This is unacceptable.",negative,neutral

"KingsDragon RC Robot Toys for Kids, Gesture & Sensing Programmable Remote Control Smart Robot for Age 3 4 5 6 7 8 Year Old Boys Girls Birthday Gift Present","My four kids love this robot!  We have had it a few days and it does everything it says it will on the box.  When we first turned it on the robot did a demo showing us all the neat things it can do.  It will say different sayings, spin and turn withe ease, play a few different songs, and has a sensor in the front that helps it know when something is in its way.  We event tried it on our carpet, and I didn't think it would go but it did! Our carpet isn't way long and it moves a little slower on it.  The remote controller works great and you can control where it goes around.  There is also a way to program up to 50 moves for it to do, then it will repeat the moves.  My kids think the ""Patrol"" button is great, it will go around the room by itself.  I like that there is a volume control so it doesn't have to be too loud.  Another way to have the robot move is by moving your hand in front of the middle of its body where there is a sensor.  By waving my hand in different directions it will either go forward, back, or turn.  Overall, I have been very impressed!  You will need a couple double A batteries for the remote.  It also comes with a charging usb cord that you could plug into a computer or a wall charger.",positive,positive

Beat That! - The Bonkers Battle of Wacky Challenges [Family Party Game for Kids & Adults],"I bought this on a whim, quarantine rekindled our family's love for game night but we are very selective. This game had us all in stitches, we all made fools of ourselves in the most competitive ways. The premise of the game is genius, you bet on yourself and complete wacky challenges in 30 seconds or against another opponent. We loved it so much we brought it to a small gathering to play it, and again with friends. Not just for kids! Adults loved it too! We found using a phone timer is easier since no one wants to watch the clock, too much action, and we added a few extra ping pong balls becuase they run off everywhere. There are so many cards we have yet to get through the deck and we have played 10+ times. Even repeating the cards is okay though because there is no guarantee you will have ""mastered"" the action. This makes for a great gift for kids, game for adults, boredom buster (kids can magange to play without an adult as well), etc.",positive,positive

I don’t know guys, I really don’t think it could have been packaged better. I think all game board boxes now-a-days are like Fabergé eggs. It is what it is.

It seemed like the 200+ pieces would be a lot, but it was full of tiny parts.  I guess if I had done my homework better I would have seen that this box does not include lots of the larger bricks that we were hoping for (2x4) in order to build larger structures.  Sure this comes with some instructions on how to build some smaller things, but my sone would rather just build random things, but these pieces didn't catch his interest at all...or the interest of his older sisters.  There are lots of colors, but again, they aren't what we wanted at all.  Finally, the box is made of cheap cardboard that doesn't hold up well to pressure most kids naturally apply.",negative,negative

"Crayola Colored Pencils Adult Coloring Set, Gift, 100 Count","If you are using these for adult coloring, you likely won't be happy with only these 36 colors.  Half of them I won't even use because they are either ugly or look the same as another color in the box.  There are too many reds and greens, few yellows, and only one purple!  At least give us a lavender or something.  For the price, I would buy the 64-pack of short colored pencils.  Instead I bought an additional pack of 50 that I saw at a store. I haven't compared pencil-to-pencil with my son's 24-pack, but I don't see much difference in terms of having the choices I want to color a picture.  Go for more than 36, or maybe a more artistic brand with a more balanced palette of colors.",neutral,neutral

The thing with this is you build it then ur done, you did all this work for 6 hours but then it just sits there, with a video game you can play it until you beat it or if its a online game you can play it forever and pretty much have endless fun until you get bored.",positive,positive

Such a wonderful surprise to open it and see all that is included. In case anyone is confused, this is just a book of sheets of stickers.

Funko Disney The Haunted Mansion - Call of The Spirits: Magic Kingdom Park Edition Game,"When I read that Funko was releasing this game, I was extremely excited (so were my gaming friends). I assumed it would include big Funko figures like the Harry Potter and other Funko games, but it doesn't. And it is so much better than those games! I've read all the negative reviews that say the directions are terrible and this game is impossible to learn, but that was not my experience at all. Perhaps because my gaming group tends to play very complex games (Mansions of Madness, Betrayal at House on the Hill, certain mystery box games, etc.) we found the rules extremely clear and the game mechanics simple yet enjoyable. Collecting card sets is fun and can be challenging depending on how everyone employs strategy throughout the game. Once you realize that the Haunt cards are based on the Hitchhiking Ghosts movement, it's easy to work/understand. The only game mechanic that we didn't think worked well was the Duel mechanic, but we may houserule that a bit to make it more compelling for us. I've played with 3 players, 5, and 6 players, and it is definitely more challenging and fun the more players there are. Additionally, as everyone is saying, the component and box design is gorgeous. Even the inside lid of the box is amazing--clearly a great deal of thought and care went into this game. I highly, highly recommend it! It has quickly become a favorite with my gaming friends and in my household!",positive,positive

It's so cute. And it seems durable and my son liked it. But the buttons aren't very intuitive. And the deal breaker was that the photo quality is unforgivably terrible. I'm an amateur photographer, and I couldn't get a clear photo no matter how well I held it still. Every single photo was grainy and pixelated. I realize this is a camera for kids, so I'm not expecting perfection. But I could get a pretend camera for way cheaper.

My only complaint, and this may be more my fault than the providers, is I expected the sheets to have more body to them. The ad said ""Premium Heavy Weigh White Bond Paper."" I think I probably should have paid more attention to the word ""bond"". That to me should have told me it would be closer to typing paper. I am NOT going to ask to return these drawing pads as I will use then for sketching. I am happy to have them and recommend them to others. Just don't buy them for coloring with any wet colors like ink pens or especially water colors which they did not say they were for. I thought they were. I DO NOT blame sellers. I will happily buy from these good people in the future.😁",positive,positive

Brain Flakes 500 Piece Interlocking Plastic Disc Set - A Creative and Educational Alternative to Building Blocks - Tested for Children's Safety - A Great Stem Toy for Both Boys and Girls,Fun building toy.  It does have lots of pieces but this is a plus for us bc lots to build.  I do store mine in a small clear bin from target. This is because once you take them out of the original bin... unless you plan to dissassemble  what is built every time... the original storage bin is useless. If you disassemble every time you can reuse the original bin but its pretty small. If your kid likes to build this is an awesome toy and good value,positive,positive

"ThinkFun Zingo Bingo Award Winning Preschool Game for Pre-Readers and Early Readers Age 4 and Up - One of the Most Popular Board Games for Boys and Girls and their Parents, Amazon Exclusive Version","At the time of this review I taught ""regular"" first grade students.  My students were on various levels (Pre-K through 2nd) when it came to reading.  One of the most difficult tasks of teaching can be making learning fun.  I found this game on Amazon and thought it might be a good addition to my small group teaching time (after a structured lesson).  The result?  ALL of my students fell in love with this game.  They would often ask to play it during their small group reading time if we had time left at the end of the lesson.  There are two sides to each card; however, even my students who were below grade level could use the ""harder"" side of the card.  The key part of this is to have the students read the word (or try to read the word) before getting the word chip.  Even though they are sight words I found it essential to help the student try to figure out the word to ensure success.  Rather than only get three in a row I often played the game where the entire card had to be filled.  At the end of the game I would always reward the students with a pencil, eraser, ticket, etc... whether or not they won.  That avoided anybody feeling like they lost.  It didn't ever delete the motivation to play because each student still wanted to win. If you want to make learning fun, try this game.",positive,positive

Ticket to Ride Board Game | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Train Game | Ages 8+ | For 2 to 5 players | Average Playtime 30-60 minutes | Made by Days of Wonder,"This is now my family's favorite game to play. Were always looking for a fun game that we can quickly (learn, setup, and play a full game). The game is a little complicated to learn because a piece moves around the outside of the board like Monopoly but in this game, the piece just moves to keep score.  The winner is not determined by who can go around the board first.  After the format of the came is learned (it just takes a couple of seconds), the rest is simple.  Your given cards that have location on them and the center of the board is a map with the corresponding location to the cards.  The entire point of the game is to make a train track that connects the locations your assigned.  The tracks and cards are worth varying amounts of points that determine the score.  Players can either concentrate on completing their assigned track or try to sabotage the other players by laying tracks to black where they think the other players need to put them. We also enjoy this game because it's difficult to find a fun 2 person game and the game is even more fun with more people.  More people mean more tracks on the board, making it more difficult to complete your own tracks. I give this game 5 stars and it will be a classic in our house, like monopoly (without the fights).",positive,positive

"Dammit Doll - Classic Random Color, Stress Relief - Gag Gift",So a damn it doll is a damn it doll. They're a great tool for those who have a hard time learning how to express frustration as long as accompanied by therapeutic resources. I gave this two starts because they sent me an all black doll that comes across as incredibly racist. One of my clients actually took it home with them (with my agreement) stating that they could not leave knowing another client might see it.

Hasbro Gaming: Jenga Classic Game,"Jenga is a classic. Purchased three of these to gift to friends, it's the ultimate housewarming gift, or even fitting to take to a dinner party. It's the perfect gift, but there is a caveat. There is a strange wood smell that we noticed on all the sets. Some of the blocks also don't fit perfectly together. Might not be a big deal, but if the misfit blocks happen to be in a few crucial junctures when playing, the Jenga tower will be even more imbalanced than it should be. Some might see this as a feature. What else do you expect for $10 or so?",positive,positive

They're low quality and the colors are great but we've noticed they come out different on paper. They're not smooth and not perfect to sharpen but if you're getting these for kids it'll do fine even though I'm sure there's better out there for the price of these.

We got these for our 3-year-old's birthday, and he's really enjoying them! I'd buy them again for anyone's kid who's into dinosaurs. :)",positive,positive

Battleship With Planes Strategy Board Game For Ages 7 and Up (Amazon Exclusive),"Imagine the excitement of a 9 year-old at Christmas who was so excited to get this gift, and wanted to challenge his dad in the first game. Now imagine the extreme disappointment and sadness of that same 9 year-old when, upon opening the gift, found out that we couldn't play the game because the game was incomplete. The upper board of one game was missing the peg board where we'd mark our hits/misses of the other player's fleet. Hasbro's Quality Department is shining through on this one........",negative,negative

Czech Games Codenames,My son and daughter-in-law brought this game on a long weekend trip together and I loved it.  It is a game that makes you think but you have fun at the same time.  It helps to know your partner well but if you can give great one word clues then no problem.  It is fast paced and not one of those games where anyone feels left out or stupid.  Pay attention and listen to the clues is my advice!!  I bought one game and then decided I needed another for our beach place so we can play no matter where we are located.  It is small and light so easy to add to your luggage.,positive,positive
Disney Buzz Lightyear Interactive Talking Action Figure - 12 Inches,"I was very excited to surprise my son with this toy as he loves Toy Story. The boxed spaceship was crushed and ripped when it came. His wings popped out maybe a handful of times before one wing refuses to close and his helmet is showing signs of not staying closed.. we've had this not even 24 hours. I would get this toy again to replace the one he has, because he absolutely loves the wings popping out and pretending he's flying. The lack of durability is not worth the prices. Which it's Disney, they can get away with a cheaply made toy, knock the price up knowing parents will buy it again. I think this design is better for display,  not as a play toy. You will have a busted toy within a few hours to a week. I wish I could find a Buzz this size and moving parts that were little stronger but it is what it is.",negative,negative

"Crayola Colored Pencils Adult Coloring Set, Gift, 100 Count","I ordered the “100 different colors” (clearly labeled on the box I received) and I understood I shouldn’t get duplicates. I did receive 100 pencils which were new and shipped without damage.  However there were 2 each of just the first 50 colors from the color chart on the back of the box. 50 of the colors on the chart we’re not included. So the whole set was duplicates! Basically I got a bunch of reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and blues. I didn’t get any browns, creams, pinks, purples, white, black, or grays. It’s impossible to complete drawing projects without all those colors. Yes some lucky customers get what they ordered and their’s come with 100 different colors, but this is a gamble purchase. I can say that isn’t always true. I gave one star because…yah technically they are pencils that come in some colors.",negative,negative

Hasbro Gaming: Jenga Classic Game,"I got this game for my daughter for Christmas. It was exactly what I was expecting. My only complaint is that the box is much bigger than the game pieces, it would make storing it and putting it away much easier if the box were the same size, as it is it's nearly impossible to put away neatly. I gave up and put all the pieces in a ziplock bag. Not ideal and it's a pain to store it that way in our game cupboard but since the tower kept falling over and messing up in the box it was the easiest solution. Aside from that it's the classic Jenga we all love! My daughter loves it and it's a fun (albeit noisy!!) addition to our Family Game Night tradition. The instructions were easy to figure out and all of my kids have proved able to play it just fine. This is a must have in any Family Game cupboard!",positive,positive

Bottom line is I think it is worth the money. My kids had a ball playing with it( 8, 5 and 1). The batteries did get wet the first time we used it. I plan on taking the batteries out and reassembling for each use. I put packing tape around the battery door the second time we used it and no water got in, so that is a potential fix, but I still wouldn’t trust it enough to not want to disassemble. It isn’t that big of a hassle to take it apart.",positive,positive

Game for Couples LOOPY - Date Night Box - Couples Games and Couples Gifts That Improve Communication and Relationships,"There are a lot of cards that deal with oral (which my partner and I aren't into) making far more than half the cards in the ""fondles"" and ""foreplay"" decks useless. The first deck is supposed to be about talking but has way more touching than the second deck which is supposed to be about fondling (again, mostly being asked to fondle with your mouth). The actual sex cards show illustrations and all positions are standard penetrative, which seems to be the only really good thing about this game. I bought it long before Christmas intending to give it to my spouse as a surprise and I am very disapointed. If I could return it I would. Minor grievence over all: the font is slightly hard to read and there are inconsistancies between the wording (boyfriend appears on some cards where partner appears on others).",negative,negative

"PicassoTiles 100 Piece Set 100pcs Magnet Building Tiles Clear Magnetic 3D Building Blocks Construction Playboards, Creativity Beyond Imagination, Inspirational, Recreational, Educational Conventional","My grandchildren love building with another brand of magnetic tiles at our local library’s children’s room.  I wanted to gift them something that would engage them during the shutdown (especially on rainy days) and knew it had to be the tiles.  After reading reviews of several brands, I decided on the Picasso Tiles.  Initially, I was drawn to the colors and shapes of these tiles  knowing that they would spark my my 4-year old grandson’s imagination. They seem sturdy and the magnets seem comparable in strength to Magna Tiles.  I also like the fact that they are compatible with other brands.  The kids love them!!  The 100 piece set is great, but I know I will buy another box soon because my grandson’s designs are intricate and grand and my granddaughter’s building skill will continue to blossom.",positive,positive

"KingsDragon RC Robot Toys for Kids, Gesture & Sensing Programmable Remote Control Smart Robot for Age 3 4 5 6 7 8 Year Old Boys Girls Birthday Gift Present","The media could not be loaded. I ordered this robot for my 4 yr olds birthday (she will be 5). Her siblings all have robots but frankly they are way above her ability understand. I was looking for a lower price robot that would make her feel like she was one of the big kids. I was pleasantly surprised when this one came. I wanted to make sure I knew how to work it before I gave it to her so I filmed a little video which I've included. It works best on a hard floor surface but would still move around on our very flat carpet. The songs were fun. It was very responsive. I haven't tried the programming yet but I think we will do that when she gets the present. I think this is perfect for kids. Cheap enough to afford, but with enough features to make the kids feel like they are one of the big kids with their robots that cost over $100. I'm very happy with this purchase.",positive,positive
Ticket to Ride Board Game | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Train Game | Ages 8+ | For 2 to 5 players | Average Playtime 30-60 minutes | Made by Days of Wonder,"The train cards are smaller than the Ticket to Ride Europe edition, but not a big deal (to remedy the card size, I suggest getting the 1910 expansion pack; also adds a few fun game variations).  We had the European one first, so we modified the rules a bit of this American one to be more similar to the other (like splitting the routes into ""long"" and ""short"" and dealing two of each at the start instead of keeping them together as the rules here suggested). Overall, this game runs the same way as the original ticket to ride.  We have not played with Alexa, so I'm not sure why the Alexa version was so discounted from the original, but I will take it! All pieces were there, so don't worry about that.  If you do want to play with Alexa, there weren't instructions for it. If you're concerned your game may be a counterfeit, I have registered my game on the Days of Wonder website without an issue! So this seller is all good. If you haven't had experience with this game before, your routes are dealt at the beginning of the game, you have to keep some of them, and the goal is to complete them before someone's train pieces run out.  The longest continuous route gets extra points, you lose points if you don't complete a route, and the worth of each segment varies based on the number of trains required to complete it. You can play nice and not interfere, or if you want to sabotage someone's progress, you can do that too. Overall, we love playing this game with friends and family. I highly recommend it.",positive,positive

Some of the pieces i'm happy with --the shoes are great!  4 pairs and they fit her well, even though she's big for her age.  (She's 3).  The jewelry, not so much.  One pair of earrings came with a broken clasp and no jewel.  The ones that do work, pinch her ears and she won't wear them.  The tiara and wand are cute, but will probably snap and break within a few days.  she was excited however, so if you are getting this for someone young, the flaws will probably not be noticed too much.",positive,positive

When my order arrived the box had been damaged and quite a few of the tools had been dislodged from the eggs.  So I was very disappointed and wrote a 3 star review.  (the first review I have ever written) The eggs and individual charts plus the one larger chart are all very good quality so maybe I should have given it 4 stars.  However, now I am definitely giving it 5 stars.  Not only is the product top quality, but the customer service can't be beat.  I will definitely be checking out their product line for future purchases!",positive,positive
Hasbro Gaming Rubik's Cube 3 x 3 Puzzle Game for Kids Ages 8 and Up,If you remember the original rubrics cube this isn't like it. The original one was stiff to turn and was frustrating.

Fisher-Price Little People Animal Friends,"I agree with the reviews regarding the seams down the middle.  These are not the soft, molded rubber animals that come with the barn. I purchased a barn in the early 2000's for my first grandchild, and over the years, some of the animals walked away.  The barn is still perfect, so I wanted to re-populate with a new set of animals for the newest grandkids.  But these are a definite disappointment. We can't even figure out  the identity of one of the animals.  (Llama?) Fisher Price, how can you do this to your loyal customers?",negative,negative

SKIP BO Card Game,"This is the type game that most companies yearn for. It's easy to learn, it can be played and enjoyed by both children and adults, and it's playing time can be varied by the number of cards in your deck. Hint, if you go with the game's instructions of 25 cards per player, then you've got a longer game. We tend to use a 15 card deck. The rules are easy enough for the younger members of the family to understand and play well, yet not be overly tedious for the adults. Granted, this means that there's not a ton of strategy involved. You just play the cards as they are drawn. On the plus side, this means that adults can readily carry on conversations and visit and not have to focus on watching what other players are doing for the sake of a winning strategy. Again, ... when it comes your turn, you just play the cards as they are drawn, then go back to pleasant conversation.",positive,positive
Melissa & Doug Stainless Steel Pots and Pans Pretend Play Kitchen Set for Kids (8 pcs),I spent way too long researching pots and pans that will never have real food in them.

"BARWA 32 pcs Doll Clothes and Accessories 10 pcs Party Dresses 22 pcs Shoes, Crown, Necklace Accessories for 11.5 inch Doll","I'm watching foster girls this week and needed quick girl toys so we thrifted some real Barbie's but they needed clothes.  So I grabbed this bundle. It didn't have to be great quality but I thought surely they'd last 5 days.  The package arrived 12 hours (or a day early) and the 8 year old had been anxiously waiting for it.  She met the lady on porch and then squealed like it was Christmas morning giving us all a laugh.  She ran in and shared with her sisters 5 & 3.  That was about 6 pm last night.  It's 9 am and I was met this morning with a very upset little girl.  The clothes are tearing up so now the sisters need her help to put them on, we chopped one frayed strap off and made a 1 strap fashion choice and I've got to figure out how to fix these 2 because they don't have these things at their foster home and were SO excited they could take these home. After shopping for clothes for them, Barbie's and Barbie clothes that would get here fast enough to play with, I knew I should've read reviews but I seriously didn't imagine they wouldn't at least last until the girls got home!!!  I'd have rated 2 stars for at least the shoes and accessories, but none of the accessories fit well. Luckily these girls aren't picky because necklaces shouldn't fall off when you tilt the doll forward.",negative,negative

SET Enterprises Five Crowns Card Game Purple,"While I don't usually like 'rummy-style' games, this game rates a 10 on my harsh scale.  It's rummy on steroids! Here's a tip that the manufacturer won't like me to share that will make your cards last 5-6 times longer.  After a hand is over, we put the used cards aside and just continue dealing from the unused cards.  People may complain that ""we used a lot of jokers (or the next wild card) already so we need to shuffle"" but after playing this way for years I can attest that it makes no difference at all because everyone is on equal footing.  I've challenged doubters to speak up if they notice one iota of difference in the play and I've had unanimous agreement that it made no difference. If playing two-handed, you'll only shuffle 3 times!  Once to begin, again after 8's are wild, and after either 11's or 12's (it varies).  3 times vs. 11 if you shuffle before every hand, greatly prolongs the life of the cards (even so, we've gone through about a dozen sets).",positive,positive

"SKYJO by Magilano - The entertaining card game for kids and adults. The ideal game for fun, entertaining and exciting hours of play with friends and family.","Love how easy this game is (if you've ever played ""Golf"" with a standard deck of cards, it's very similar to that but with it's own specialized deck that makes the game way better). And LOVE how quick it is. The rounds go fairly quick especially if you don't play with more than 6 (we usually play in groups of four, and my husband and I really enjoy playing just the two of us  as well. It's fun no matter how many are playing.) And you can make the final score lower if you want a faster game. Just love this game. Highly recommend and we find ourselves playing this all the time now, and skipping our other games (and we love classic card and board games). We like our other games still, but we seem to always end up playing this one right now. I think it's stage of life. Before kids we loved Settlers of Catan and games like that. We still like those, but they are hard on the brain right now. Truly, the ability to play quickly and get interrupted and step away and come back and not need to keep huge strategy over the course of an entire game is really helpful for us in this stage of life (parents of a 2 & 4 year old).",positive,positive

They had so many different kinds of stickers to choose from and alot of different genres of stickers (from dinosaurs to cartoon animals). But once they started playing with them, they fell apart too easily. I know I shouldnt have expected much, but damn. These stickers are pressed plastic over adhesive foam. The reason why i know this is that the plastic keep popping off after a few minutes. That wouldnt be too bad, but kids are bound to put them in there mouths and maybe swallow them. I wouldnt buy these again or recommend them to my friends.",negative,negative

I got an EvolutionS pack and the code card was BACKWARDS. Whoever opened my pack must have had to replace the card, taken out the rare that was in it, and given me a resealed pack and accidentally put in the code card backwards. Very disappointing... I have yet to open an EvolutionS pack with a rare inside from a 3rd party vendor.",negative,negative
"Pressman Charades for Kids -- The 'No Reading Required' Family Game, 5""",This game entertains our daughter just fine. But there are a lot of strange charade options lots of kids won’t know - especially the pictures. I am using 1/5 of the cards right now but eventually we will use them all The other issue is the card quality is very poor. They are not cut straight and have some little edges sticking out. It doesn’t make sense to me at the price point to have these issues since the game is basically just cards in a box - similar to say codenames or dominion and both those games have MUCH higher quality cards,neutral,neutral
"LEGO Creator Mighty Dinosaurs 31058 Build It Yourself Dinosaur Set, Create a Pterodactyl, Triceratops and T Rex Toy (174 Pieces)","I got a couple of these sets and was impressed by the versatility of the pieces. Y 3 year old was able to complete the models with a little assistance.  Lego.com also provided additional instructions to build a diplodocus, dinosaur airplane, and anklosaurus.  Another website had instructions for a mantis and baby dragon (see picture). This set complements other retired sets such as Ferocious Creatures and Mythical Monsters.  No doubt, Lego will release something similar in a couple years. I can't recommend paying more than $18 for this set though.  For $20 or more, there are plenty of others you can get and which have more pieces.",neutral,positive
Tamagotchi Pix - Floral (Pink) (42901),"I consider myself a long time tama collector. I do love most of the new ideas they’re implementing in the Pix and I can’t wait to check everything out. First and foremost the biggest drawback for me are the A, B, and C buttons being touch sensitive instead of push buttons, ONLY because they really don’t work as they shouldn’t most of the time. I actually returned my first one because I thought it was defective. Really frustrating to see this be such a fail, the buttons are a big part of the experience. The camera is kind of a joke, like I feel like they just got a good deal on a big batch of cameras leftover from the early 2000’s and stuck them in the pix and programmed around them. I get that this is a toy and only $60 but I truly believe it’s possible to acquire cheaper quality cameras in this decade. Beyond those couple pretty major issues, I’m still excited to explore the pix more and interact with the characters.",neutral,neutral

LCR® Left Center Right™ Dice Game - Blue Tin,"I would give this game 10 stars if I could! I played this game at a party I went to and had to get one for our house. I broke it out at our big family Thanksgiving. My family isn't really into games much, but agreed to play after I insisted. We played with three dollars each instead of the chips. Who can't afford three dollars? By the end of the game EVERYBODY was hooting and hollering with excitement!! We ended up playing four times. Anybody can play, there is no skill involved at all, its pure chance. Even when you think you're out, you can still win! Great to play with any age.

"Regal Games - Kids Classic Card Games - May Include Old Maid, Go Fish, Slapjack, Crazy 8's, War, and Silly Monster Memory Match or Banapples Jr - for Family Game Nights, Parties - Set of 6 Games","These are great classics, yet the cards are difficult to see while holding. The OLD MAID cards get divided between all of the players before you match them up leaving players holding about 15 to 20 cards. That's quite a handful and would be much more manageable if there was marked corners like on typical playing cards. We were constantly flipping through the cards to see what we had. Mind you, we were all adults playing this game (simple fun). I would imagine it would be extremely frustrating for a young small child to handle and flip through.",positive,positive

I like the three different types of cards. The ice breakers made it easy to start the game bc we were kind of at a loss when we got it but the ice breakers made it really easy to get the ball rolling.

"Crayola Ultra Clean Washable Markers, Broad Line Markers, Gifts, 40 Classic Colors","Okay, I love Crayola products. So, don't think that I am downing the quality. Simply, I found the packaging misleading. There are NOT sixty (60) different colors in this pack. There are twelve (12) standard colors in four boxes, plus some fun window markers and gel markers. If you want a larger color selection, buy the 40-pack of broad tips that is actually all different colors, no repeats. If you use these standard colors a lot, and use the other colors as accents, this is a great box because you won't run out of red anytime soon. The customer image that shows all the different colors is NOT this product! I don't know who posted that, but they are either confused or trying to mislead buyers.",neutral,neutral
"KingsDragon RC Robot Toys for Kids, Gesture & Sensing Programmable Remote Control Smart Robot for Age 3 4 5 6 7 8 Year Old Boys Girls Birthday Gift Present","My kids are 10 girl and 6 boy.  They were both really excited to try it.  I charged it during dinner and it was plenty charged to play with when dinner was over.  I put in the 2 AA batteries needed for the remote and they were immediately able to play with it.  I liked that the instructions were mostly basic and self explanatory so that the kids could figure out how to use it very easily.  They liked how it could dance and it has surprisingly really good balance both on tiles and on carpet.  We have 6x6 inch tiles through much of our house and the robot didn't tip over going from tile to tile.  It has a couple of cute little tunes that it can play.  The ""patrol"" button actually works pretty well so it won't run into walls.  Most of the Robot's voice we could understand.  There were a few words that seemed difficult to understand.  It's like the Robot's voice has an accent on it's English but it doesn't stop my six year old son from enjoying it.  The hand motions worked well except the back-up hand motion seems to be tough for it to pick up and sometimes thinks you are wanting him to turn.  My kids want to get the other one now too.  We ordered the blue.  I love the volume button especially!!  My son can turn down the volume when I want him to play more quietly.  The robot is light enough that my son picks it up and flies it through a room too.",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Reusable Sticker Pad: Habitats - 150+ Reusable Stickers 7 Ounces,"The line of reusable puffy stickers works great, but the line of slimmer stockers, such as these, sometimes works and sometimes does not.  The surface for the thinner stickers is different, because the stickers that will not stick to this surface will stick to the book/puffy sticker surface.  And it does not always work to put a whale in a fairy setting or a house/closet/clothing setting.  I try to make the environments real, since I use these for teaching in online classes.  I noticed the stickers that do not stick to the surface will actually stick to a whiteboard surface. The stickers are bright and colorful.  I like them a lot.  I just wish they would work.  I am not sure why some of this set will stick and others will not.",neutral,neutral
Ticket to Ride Board Game | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Train Game | Ages 8+ | For 2 to 5 players | Average Playtime 30-60 minutes | Made by Days of Wonder,"This game is a ton of fun. 2-5 players. sounds like an odd number but i think 6 would be to full of a board and no one would be able to complete their trains. The game shares some similarities to settlers of katan. but i like this one better. The object is to build trains from one major city to another on the board which is a cartoony version of a map of the lower 48 states. (Unfortunately not all of Obama's 57 states.) There are other version of the game as well such as a European version. A player picks up a mission card to see which two cities they need to connect by building a train. They build trains by collecting the colored cards to match the section of railroad drawn on the board. Two players can block eachother by trying to use the same rail, however, more than one rail can be used to get to each city. The expansion set is also recamended as it adds more missions and more colored cards so you dont run out so fast when play with the full 5 players.",positive,positive

I wasn't sure if the quality would ve as good as my daughter's was but it turned out just as nice. I love it and the kids love it. Great toy and you can't go wrong gifting this to someone.",positive,positive
Don't Break the Ice Game,"I liked that it was same concept as the retro Don't Break the Ice.  Gave as a gift to a 2 year old that I nanny.  I definitely have to set it up for us to play, and I can't say that we follow the rules at this point, but he's  having fun anyway!  It does need to be put up out of reach when not playing or one of parts will get lost and then it'd be useless",positive,positive

Hanes Men's Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt Value Pack (4-pack),"I bought these to use as the lining fabric for masks for healthcare workers during the coronavirus situation, so I can't really speak to shrinkage since I didn't wear them. However, I was disappointed with the quality of these. The whole reason I use T-shirts is to give wearers a soft and breathable yet densely knit fabric. These were not very soft, and the cut edges frayed in a very strange ""crumbly"" way. The label says 100% cotton though. I'm assuming they must have used some low grade short cotton fibers or something, because I've never seen tshirt fabric behave this way.",negative,negative

"Disney Pixar Toy Story 4 Woody and Bullseye 2-Character Pack, Movie-inspired Relative-Scale for Storytelling Play [Amazon Exclusive]","I will preface this with saying--my son got this for Christmas with money he got (he's 3) and he LOVED it.  He is a three year old boy, so not the most gentle, but has treated this pretty respectfully.  For a toy marketed to little boys, the quality is TERRIBLE.  Woody's legs FALL OFF.  It's broken.  Two weeks.  I cannot afford to replace it and he is devastated. :( :( :(  I don't have the box, so cannot contact the manufacturer either.",negative,negative

They don't adhere well. If you have a sticker - obsessed toddler like I do, these are great. I've been able to remove them from just about every surface... My toddler loves sticking them everywhere. They're easy for her to peel off on her own and I didn't get any double. They're also larger than some other brands which is nice. A few of my sheets were damaged as pictured but the stickers themselves were fine.",neutral,positive

Melissa & Doug Cutting Fruit Set - Wooden Play Food Kitchen Accessory,I purchased this to go with the kitchen set that was the farm to table set.

"Tara Toys Disney Princess Necklace Activity Set, 9.7x8.18x2","My 3-yr-old daughter has been playing with this for hours at a time for days on end. This may be her favorite Christmas gift, even more than her new tricycle. She loved it so much she wanted to wear it to bed, in the bath, and on her first day of back at preschool. (Obviously I would never let her wear this to sleep, just sharing her sentiment and excitement). It’s a great value for what you get. Admittedly there aren’t that many beads with how heavy handed she likes to get. So I went to Michael’s and bought more. Cost me $35 in beads vs $15 for this whole set. I’ll probably get her a different character set at some point.",positive,positive
"Crayola Light Up Tracing Pad Pink, Gifts for Girls & Boys, Age 6, 7, 8, 9",Difficult for a 7-8 year old to use. There is nothing to hold the paper on the screen in order to trace.

"Exploding Kittens - A Russian Roulette Card Game, Easy Family-Friendly Party Games - Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids - 2-5 Players","I can't, for the life of me, figure out why this game is so popular on Amazon. High ratings and at the time of this review, 25k+ reviews! I seriously thought this was an obvious slam dunk. The amount of cards that come with this game is insanely scarce, especially for $20. The deck is just so extremely small. The quality of the actual cards and box it comes in is nice. The artwork on the cards is.... honestly, it's just terrible. If you've played Unstable Unicorns, you know that this sort of ""weird"" artwork can actually be nice (sorry, I don't know what the official genre of art is). But the art on Exploding Kittens was borderline repulsive lol Just not appealing at all. Grossed me out more than once, and not in a funny type of way. Neither my husband or I really understood the ""point"" of the game. I wouldn't say this a good two player game, and maybe that's my hangup. There just isn't enough going on. Unstable Unicorns is another card game that is similarly priced with the same amount and level of reviews, but that game beats this one 100% hands down. If you're poking around for a new game and don't have either of these, I'd try Unstable first. It's got some strategy, way more cards and is infinitely more fun.",negative,negative

SET Enterprises Five Crowns Card Game Purple,"Our extended family has really enjoyed this game. During Covid lockdown we have discovered that we can play this game over Zoom--of course, each family joining in must have their own Five Crowns Card Game, and that does change the dynamics of the game somewhat, but other than the obvious implications for dealing the cards, the rules remain the same. We find it works best to have each member at a given Zoom site take their turn before moving to the next Zoom site. It helps if each member announces, ""I discarded"" or ""I went down"" at the end of their turn. It isn't quite the same as being in the same house, but it sure beats the cancelling of our weekly family game night. A bonus, of course, is the ability to include in game night those who live to far away to drop in on a weekly basis.",positive,positive

I've been a gamer since birth, from board games and chess through the birth of video games, i can tell you this IS a GOOD game.",positive,positive

I even like how when you remove the stethoscope from Barbie you can put it back on without it falling off.",positive,positive
"Funko Pop!

"Play-Doh Modeling Compound 10-Pack Case of Colors, Non-Toxic, Assorted, 2 oz. Cans, Ages 2 and up, Multicolor (Amazon Exclusive)","I got these as a gift for my 3yr old godson. The package arrived on time and was as described. If you read the product title it states the cans are 2oz. The small size of the containers are perfect for little guys to play with, but if you’re doing anything more than free play or stamping you might want the regular sized cans. Cost is about .80 cents per can which is how much you pay for the full sized ones at the store so, I gave the product a 4 star for that reason. I actually didn’t price it out until I was reading a review after I had already bought it. If you have the time to go somewhere local I’d advise doing so since you’ll get more for your money.",positive,positive

Bought one of these for my daughter and one for my son back in September for Christmas.  He opened his today and it doesn’t even turn on after charging.  Naturally because I started shopping early, the return window is closed so this is now junk and money down the drain.  Very disappointing but not as disappointing as my son’s camera not working and him watching his sister using hers without any issue.

"Learning Resources Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register - 73 Pieces, Ages 3+ Develops Early Math Skills, Play Cash Register for Kids, Toy Cash Register, Play Money for Kids","Everything about this register is cute. It works great. The calculator is correct, the play money is okay, I bought a separate set for dollar bills and coins that look a little more realistic. The credit card works and the sound is loud. The only reason I am removing 2 stars is that every time you open the cash register it comes out really forcefully that the coins fall out and some bills as well sometimes. She is a little older and doesn't want me to return it and said she will hold her hand on the drawer and then push the open button so she can control the drawer better. In another word, it hits her hand and she guides it out afterward. I feel like if the child were smaller it might hurt them. I spent a lot more on this one thinking I was going to get a better product. I think someone should have noticed this and fixed it before releasing it to be sold to kids.",negative,negative
Tamagotchi Pix - Floral (Pink) (42901),"This is a good toy, my kid loved it.  But you have to replace the 2 AAA batteries after only 5-7 days depending on how much you use it.  Luckily it does not reset while you change the battery, but still...that's really poor design.",neutral,neutral

Rummikub - Classic Edition - The Original Rummy Tile Game by Pressman,"Quite a bit like the real Rummy card game but with tiles instead of cards.  So you may be saying ""Well why don't I just pick up a $1 pack of cards and play rummy?"" Mmm... good question.  But actually this game is a lot more fun. The tiles make things move visual.  It's easier to see the wild tiles and make substitutions and melds and runs which makes the whole game play a lot easier.  The enclosed rack holds your tiles in front of you which is a lot nicer than holding cards in your hand. The tile game is faster paced and fun for the family on a rainy afternoon at the lake.  Until your sister packs up the game and heads home leaving you stranded for another 3 days of rain.  Grumble grumble.  But I'm off topic... The tiles in this game are a decent weight.  They feel solid.  The Rack is a bit on the flimsy side and could use a bit of improvement.  But overall, the game is good quality and lots of fun.  I was surprised by the price!  Well done Amazon!  This thing is $30 back home in Canada.",positive,positive

Terrible presentation, and not suitable for a gift.  I had previously purchased the pack of 24 3-oz cans and the cans were in a bright, pretty box with cute ideas for using the play-doh.  Very disappointing and certainly the super heavy duty corrugated brown carton, which wasn't suitable to keep the cans in anyway, would have had less of an ""environmental packaging footprint"" if it was lighter weight and the cans were in that, properly housed in an attractive lightweight cardboard box of their own.",negative,neutral

Got this as a birthday gift for my 3 year old and I feel like whatever is in there would be a mess anyway lol. She loves getting into my makeup so I got her this and she loves it. The colors of all the makeup are perfect for a toddler, not all crazy or overly pigmented. She loves wearing the lipsticks, eyeshadow, and lip gloss. The other day, she got some of the red lipstick on the wall and it stained. So. Definitely be aware of that! It seems to be pretty easy to remove from skin though overall.

I am really a big fan of LEGO achitecture because it can really replicate the the famous, beutiful landmarks around the world. It can also give kids a visualization of what that landmark looks like.

Cards Against Humanity,"If you like to laugh, and you don't take life too seriously then you will likely enjoy this game.  If you are the type to be easily offended I would RUN, because this is likely the most offensive game you will ever play.  I mean the name ""Card's against humanity"" kinda hints at that though.  You will feel like you need a preacher, some holy water, to wach your mouth out with soap etc. after making some of the choices you make in this game.  You will feel even MORE guilty laughing your BOOTY off at it.  It's wrong.  Oh so wrong....yet so right.  You learn a lot about a person's humor when playing this game.  That is part of the concept actually.  If you are good at reading people you will quickly learn the patterns of a person's decision making.  Some people like to choose the ""best fit"", some like to choose anything that has to do with bodily functions, Some like to choose the most random answer possible and some will choose anything that has an animal involved.  You will learn this about people (hopefully) and be able to customize your ""answers"" to give yourself a better chance at winning.  That leaves me with the ""CONCEPT"" of the game.  It's pretty easy.  Everyone gets a set number of answer cards that they do not show anyone.  Then one at a time someone will read a question card.  everyone (other than person asking the question), is then to put down the best answer to that question from the cards they have in their hand.  The person who asked the question then reads them all out loud (this is where you will CRY laughing at some of the answers) and then selects which card they feel is best.  Whoever placed that card down gets a point.  Most points in the end wins.  Simple, silly, fun.  Don't play with your grandmother unless she is a dirty, dirty lady ;-) The box is small so it is an easy game to bring to a party or on vacation.  It is easy to store away and pull out for an instant drinking game and fun time (with the right crowd obviously).",negative,positive
"Animals Figure,54 Piece Mini Jungle Animals Toys Set,ValeforToy Realistic Wild Vinyl Plastic Animal Learning Party Favors Toys for Boys Girls Kids Toddlers Forest Small Animals Playset Cupcake Topper","These are nice quality (for being cheap plastic animals), but beware that 25 of the pieces are fence plus grass plus multiple parts of ONE TREE. ""Extra pieces"" as follows: 16-fence 4-grass 1-tree TRUNK 5-tree LEAVES (All for the same tree) Now that I look at the pictures, this is clear, however the fact that one tree count as six pieces kind of cheeses me off, you know?",neutral,neutral
"Stickers for Kids, 3D Puffy Stickers, 64 Different Sheets, 3200+ Stickers, Including Animals, Cars, Airplane, Food, Letters, Flowers, Pets, Cakes and Tons More",Do not buy these for little kids!!! They are so small! One customer compared them to the size of a child’s fingernail. I’d say that’s pretty accurate. Do not be fooled by the pictures from the company!!!,negative,negative
"Kids Face Masks Reusable, Washble Cloth Face Mask for Boys Girls, Adjustable Stretch Ear Protection Loops, Tip Faces Breathable Comfortable Cotton Polyester Fiber Face Masks for Child School Outdoor",I bought this for my kid and he likes it very much.

"2 Pack Cartoon Remote Control Cars - Police Car and Race Car - Radio Control Toys for Kids, Boys, & Girls - Each with Different Frequencies So Both Can Race Together - Gifts for Toddler Boys Ages 2-4","My 3 year old nephew LOVES these. Actually, we ALL love these. They're super simple to use so kids are able to figure out how they work quickly. Adults enjoy the challenge of making these things go where they want with limited controls. Win-win. Only bummer: despite being relatively durable, kids like to carry them by the antenna (pretty sure I've grabbed it once or twice that way myself) and we think this may have led one of them to stop working. I feel like this is really a risk of buying any toy like this for toddlers/young children, which is why I still chose to give this item 5 stars.",positive,positive
Infantino Press & Stay Sensory Blocks,"Purchased the Infantino Sensory Press and Stay Sensory Blocks for my 2 yr old grandson. The blocks are not easy to stack and even with pressure they do not stick together, they fall apart. Definitely not  Frustration-Free as stated in the product description.  Returning both boxes I purchased , so not worth the money.",negative,negative
"LEGO Star Wars Stormtrooper Helmet 75276 Building Kit, Cool Star Wars Collectible for Adults (647 Pieces)","I've purchased and assembled all three of these helmets. As far as the build and look I would say this is #2. The TIE fighter helmet is my #1, and Boba Fett is #3. Each helmet stands alone very well and they are all fun to build, but sitting side by side, they rank in that order for me. As others have said the price seems steep, but these are not a child's lego set, and are a decent scale and challenge for the price. All three sets I purchased had ever part with a few spares. I did overlook a part left in a bag and momentarily had that dreaded feeling of having to wait for a part. I've built several sets lately, and have not been short any parts, they do sometimes get stuck in the bag. Anyway, I think any Star Wars fan would enjoy this for its display value. My wife loves all of them and we enjoyed putting them together, now we just have to figure out where to put them.",positive,positive

There is fun inside this box, at least 1 hour of fun, everyday!!!",positive,positive

They feel cheap as hell but are actually fairly rugged. They dont sound like the audio would be high quality when you just que the mic and not talk, but the radios have auto squelch that makes the voice transmit sound perfect. My wife and I use these when out and about to keep track of eachother and the kids. Its much faster than a text and is about 10,000 times more reliable than a cell phone. For work I use $400 Motorola UHF radios and honestly, these $20 radios have better audio quality.",positive,positive

She fell in love with one of these at a colleagues house and I had to get her one.

SET Enterprises Five Crowns Card Game Purple,"Fun game for all ages! My Aunt introduced this game to us a few years ago. She usually finds these quirky games from garage sales or from friends at Church. Most are so-so and not really enjoyable. This one, however, is so much fun!! We liked playing it so much when we visited, we bought one for every family members house so we could play no matter which family we were visiting. This game is/used to be available at Target, but hadn’t seen it in stock for over a year. We played so much, we needed to get a new set, but couldn’t find 5 Crowns online or in store anywhere! Amazon had the disclaimer “we don’t know when this will be back in stock” so I thought they were discontinuing it. When it randomly showed a limited quantity back in stock, I bought two more for my house, another set for at my parents house, and a back up set for another aunts house. My niece and nephew, ages 8 & 10 at the time we started playing, enjoyed playing even tho this card game made them think and even use Math skills to add up their points. Get a couple when they are available as you will be playing 5 Crowns every time the family gets together!!",positive,positive

"Crayola Ultra Clean Washable Markers, Broad Line Markers, Gifts, 40 Classic Colors","I absolutely love the size of these! I have really small hands for an adult sadly :( But they were a perfect fit for me! The reason I’m giving it 4 stars is well because 3 of my markers no joke were completely dry, others were split down the middle? It’s super weird. One that was suppose to be a blue egg shell color literally was white from no ink being in it so I had to throw it away, I noticed the day I opened them. So that was weird, and I’m sad about it. I didn’t want to deal with the hassle of returning because most of them were in great shape. So not sure what happened with my ink in the blue. Lol.

So easy to learn and drive. We had hours and hours of fun driving them inside and outside. Even running into each other they held up absolutely beautifully... rugged little cars. I love that they run on different frequencies so there is no confusion.  My grandson who is just sitting up loves to watch them and loves the lights and sounds they do.

"Hatchimals Pixies, Crystal Flyers Starlight Idol Magical Flying Pixie Toy with Lights, Kids Toys for Girls Ages 6 and up",I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She opened it and hit to use it one time only before it broke. We turned it on and it immediately flew up and hit the ceiling then went to the ground. Now it has a broken wing as a result & it will not fly again. I’ve looked for a replacement wing without luck. I have a sad child and money wasted.,negative,negative

Customers BEWARE!!!! PICTURE of DINOS IS MISLEADING!!!! Description of dinosaur is MISLEADING!!!! The Dinosaurs  range from 5” to 8”. They are small, total opposite of what is shown. Thankful for Amazon’s quick returns. The PRICE is definitely NOT worth it. I sent these dinosaurs back and got my money back. Not worth the price at all. Highly disappointed!!!!

"Star Wars The Child Animatronic Edition 7.2-Inch-Tall Toy by Hasbro with Over 25 Sound and Motion Combinations, Toys for Kids Ages 4 and Up , Green","The media could not be loaded. It was just slightly smaller than I expected but I think it adds to the ""cuteness"" factor. Don't listen to the haters...its a great item for ""Mandalorian"" Fans. It is really for collectors and older fans. Little children would tear it up quickly I'm sure...thats what the plushies are for! Could have more sounds and actions but thats a minor quibble. I replaced the stock batteries with new alkalines and he is more responsive and has sharper movements now. The instructions are pretty lame but basically you give him 1 firm tap to the head to activate some cooing and head with eye movement...3 firm taps to the head will result in more sounds and ""force"" activation with raised arm. Lie him on his back to close his eyes and put him to sleep complete with snoring. My only real problem is the lack of sensitivity to his sensors. I leave him on on my desk. It takes as while for him to react after he has been dormant for a while . A few extra taps to get him going. For the $$$ he is my ""go to"" Child though. Pretty cool...",positive,positive
Hasbro Gaming Rubik's Cube 3 x 3 Puzzle Game for Kids Ages 8 and Up,"First one I've had since the mid-80s. Moves easily, perhaps too much. I can over-rotate a face such that it will not quickly move again without correcting the over-rotation. Not for speed cubing but certainly excellent for learning. I have been using Robbie Gonzales' ""How to solve a Rubik's cube"" (Wired Magazine) on YouTube. Forces the brain to learn and remember new things. I love it!",positive,positive
"Kinetic Sand, The Original Moldable Sensory Play Sand Toys for Kids, Green, 2 lb. Resealable Bag, Ages 3+","HATED this product. It got a little bit wet and stuck to everything like cement. There is no warning label telling you that getting it wet will ruin it and of course the toddlers wanted to add water just like real sand. It took 45 minutes of scrubbing, towel drying, and repeating to get it off the hands. The toys are still hopelessly coated in this sandy cement. It appears to have clogged the drains too. Never again.",negative,negative

Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza,"When we bought this game, my husband and I tried it out to see if it's a game we would gift or recommend to others. It's not made for two players and we could see we'd be in play forever, but we laughed and guffawed and challenged ourselves just the same as we do during other fun games. We decided to buy a few more decks as gifts and look forward to playing with family over the holidays. My only concern is the slapping of the deck. Little hands could smart from bigger hands slapping down on them (my husbands hands are almost twice the size of mine).",positive,positive

I gave these out for Halloween for trick or treaters but I took a few out that I thought were a bit risqué and less gender neutral (there are a few that are dress up style girls but they kind of look weird and pantless - my fiancé and I had a good laugh about these though). There are also a few phrases that seem a bit off / English as a second language to an American speaker but not sure that kids would care. And I think there was one word with an extra space or something minor like that. Overall, good price and fun variety. They had some neat sports cars ones that seemed kind of unique, fruit ones, you get the idea. Oh and don’t worry, I also gave out candy for Halloween... not looking to get my house egged. 😊",neutral,neutral

"CUTE STONE Color Changing Kitchen Sink Toys, Children Heat Sensitive Electric Dishwasher Playing Toy with Running Water, Automatic Water Cycle System Play House Pretend Role Play Toys for Boys Girls","We like this sink, and at $35 instead of $120 it's quite a bit cheaper than the Lovevery sink, which also breaks quickly. The repair: Take the plastic cover on the tap mechanism off to examine the motor. At the base where the water intake occurs, look for small holes. We found a small piece of dust trapped in a hole. Remove the dust and it should turn on again. Others have commented that you have to be really careful not to let any material other than water get into the pump mechanism, but we were very careful and we still had this issue. A permanent fix may be placing a fine mesh over the holes to prevent particles entering the motor. It's a shame neither this company nor Lovevery has added this feature!",positive,positive

This was a great way to get back into Lego. It probably took me around 6 hours over a couple days to put it all together, it was super fun, I had no missing pieces and the instruction manual was great. I love the look of the finished product and keep it on my bedside table in a tall canning jar. Would recommend to any adult fans of Lego that want a super fun piece to keep in their home. The box says 18+ to put the kit together, and based on the amount of small pieces I would say this isn't for young children, but I think a competent teenager could put this kit together just fine.",positive,positive

Huge mistake giving it to her in advance and buying it in general because it’s very cheaply made. Everything is super hollow plastic and my daughter with little to no pressure broke the lipstick as she was taking the cap off to pretend to put it on.

"ThinkFun Zingo Bingo Award Winning Preschool Game for Pre-Readers and Early Readers Age 4 and Up - One of the Most Popular Board Games for Boys and Girls and their Parents, Amazon Exclusive Version","There are two ways to play.  One with matching numbers with the amount of items on the card.  Or matching numbers with addition problems on the card. Both ways are fun and educational. On the cards with ""items""  the number word is also  present.  So the child can either count the items and match with the Arabic number or she can match the word with the number. On the cards with addition problems:  there are only items, so the child has to count the items and then match the number. It was okay.  I think having the written word on the cards added confusion once we flipped over to addition since before the child may just match word and  number.  And on the other side they have to match picture with number.  Though this may be a good thing if your child needs to work on understanding 1:1",neutral,neutral

When the caps get left off and they dry out, they can be easily re hydrated by putting a small amount of water in the cap (too much water and you get a messy marker, but not a big deal), putting the cap on the marker and letting them sit for a while. I run around and collect dry markers after my two year old goes to sleep at night and get them soaking overnight so they are ready for him the next morning. I have re hydrated them at least a dozen times, and they are still nice and bright!",positive,positive

"Exploding Kittens - A Russian Roulette Card Game, Easy Family-Friendly Party Games - Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids - 2-5 Players","If you are like me and love the normal pack of exploding kittens and imploding kittens(the first expansion) you are going to love this game.  You can play without the Imploding kittens pack but you do need the original or the party pack in order to play.  This game adds a ton of strategy but is still based on luck as well.  Here is a summary of what each of the cards do. The streaking kitten allows you to hold one exploding kitten in your hand without dying.  However, it can be taken from you and get you killed. The catamic bomb card brings all the exploding kittens to the top of the pile.  Does not include the imploding kitten. The swap top and bottom card is where you switch the top and bottom cards. The Mark card is where you can pick a card from someone else's hand to be public until it is played or stolen. There is one see the future of the first five cards and one alter the future of the first five cards.",positive,positive

Neato! 41-Piece Pick-Up Sticks Game,"It's quite a trip to walk down memory lane when sitting down and playing this game. Takes me right back to my childhood, and the game itself is fun. This particular set is made of nice quality wood, which makes it almost feel like you are playing with a collectable rather than a toy. The only complain I have is the Black stick and blue ones are so close in color, and takes good lighting to see the difference. Other than that, it is a great product, feels great, and so much fun to play with. I highly recommend it, and a nice fun game for rainy days.",positive,positive

My daughter took half a day to get used to it since she was scared at first as it could talk. Once I explained to her that it is her robot friend Mashuko(from her favourite series Masha), she loves it so much. The price is reasonable, quite a few functions to play with and since it is interactive, it will keep your kids busy. Arrived earlier than expected which is definitely a bonus.

"Crayola My First Safety Scissors, Toddler Art Supplies, 3ct",They are safe in the sense they won’t cut your child. They barely cut paper. You have to have the paper perfectly straight with good tension to get the scissors to cut. I have hit or miss success with them. My child (3yo) can get the paper to cut but only if she holds the scissors in a way that is incorrect and would be unsafe if she were using normal scissors.,positive,positive

Hygge Games ...I should have known that! Trivia Game Green,My family played this game and it was enjoyed for the most part.

Some were so easy that even I knew the answers and other questions were challenging.  It was a good variety and it didn't seem to make anyone feel like they were stealing the show and nobody felt stupid either.  I look forward to playing again.,neutral,neutral

Buying the board game version opened up options for playing with family members and expanded my board game collection. The quality was great! It lies flat on the table and the pieces are good quality. I ordered the little plastic steamer trunks to store all the little train cars inside of. They are advertised seperately and really make it a nicer gift. I highly recommend this game as it is an excellent choice for all ages and easy to learn.

"ZEN Bundles Zen Pipe Cleaners Hard Bristle, 132 Count (Pack of 3)","I saw other reviews describe how these are pokey and flake, but it looks, and feels exactly like fiberglass to me. They arrived in a bag which was covered in fine particles. Touching them feels just like fiberglass, as it stings and itches on skin, and washing it off does little to help. I rinsed them to use to clean my faucet, but even after several rinses I could still feel the irritation and sting from the pipe cleaners on the faucet. I also had hoped to use these to clean reusable straws, but that doesn't seem safe at all! They are garbage.",negative,negative

I bought this to ""pay"" my daughters for the chores they do around house and for doing kind things for others (I think real money is filthy dirty). When they want to buy something at the store they turn in their play money to me while shopping and I pay for the item with my debit card. Its a way to teach them the value of money, aspects of shopping, understanding price of items to the amount of money they have and if they loose the money they aren't loosing actually money. I started the chore jars two months ago and they love it, especially my 5 year old. Can't wait till they get home to show them the ""new money"" I got!!",positive,positive
"Cephalofair Games Gloomhaven: Jaws of The Lion Strategy Boxed Board Game for ages 12 & Up , Brown","I hate reviews that are not about the overall experience of the product so I am sorry that I'm providing one now. However, I feel this is more beneficial (or in line with a product review) than those about the package being lost, damaged, or out of return policy since that doesn't properly represent the product. ACTUAL PRODUCT PACKAGING REVIEW: I just received the game (about 30 minutes ago) and, although I'll probably love the game, I'm a little disappointed with the packaging. At initial glance, I thought the box was damaged because it was bulging (i.e. one side about a 1/2 inch higher than the other when sealed). Upon opening the box, I saw that it was due to the box being poorly designed. It barely holds the game after all the items are punched out and stored ""properly"" in the box. I quoted ""properly"" because I still can't figure out how to get everything to fit inside without the box bulging a little. As it stands and if using the original insert, it's an extremely tight squeeze to the point I keep checking to make sure nothing is being bent. I wish the product/box designer would have given .25 to .50 inch more room for to allow a few more imperfect ways to repackage the game. That said (and even though I hate doing this), I may just remove the insert(s) to allow more ways to configure the game for repackaging purposes.",negative,negative

She loves everything that came with it. I'm pleasantly surprised with the quality of the mirror. She does like to take the ear pieces off of the glasses, but they pop on as easily as they come off (kinda wished they stayed on with screws or something, but oh well). The keys are cute, but I wish the key chain was more of a remote because my daughter likes my keys for the reason that she can push the buttons. She loves the lipstick, but I keep the lid hidden so she doesn't choke on it. Besides the small things I wished it had, I love that it comes with so many accessories and it's super cute.",positive,positive

"LEGO Star Wars: The Mandalorian The Razor Crest 75292 Exclusive Building Kit, New 2020 (1,023 Pieces)","Up until recently, I haven't built a Lego set for a very long time, and this kit was fun to assemble. I just finished building the massive 1969 piece Saturn V rocket and promptly went out and bought the Razor Crest kit. The manual is very detailed, as expected and I did not have any missing pieces. There's really only one thing I didn't care for, and that was having to apply decals to some parts. The Saturn V kit came with parts that had the designs already applied, where this kit requires you to place the stickers on a handful of pieces. Not terribly hard, but it feels cheap vs parts with designs applied already. I know this was common back in the 1990s when I was a kid building sets, just figured they would have got away from that. Anyway, I love the minifigs and the micro Grogo figure. This set looks great on my shelf and I'll probably continue picking up a set here and there to put together when life allows free time to do such things.",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug 20 Wooden Animal Magnets in a Box,"We just received these animal magnets in the mail a few days ago, and my 22 month old son immediately fell in love with the magnets - transferring them from the fridge to the dishwasher, taking them down and putting them back up again. I'm encouraging him to sort them by color, to practice their names and sounds. A lot of different ways to play with these and to help your child learn about animals. I suspect these may only look new for a few weeks. They are wood pieces but the image itself is more like laminated paper which makes the edges susceptible to wearing easily. That being said, I love Melissa & Doug and out of the other similar products I found at this price, I think these are a good buy.",positive,positive

I can live with the plastic trays (although I prefer the wooden ones, like the ones I already have). My biggest complaint is that the tiles are all wrong! They are about 1mm longer and wider than the original tiles. The tiles are painted, not embossed. The font is wrong. If I had wanted tiles like this, I would have purchased one of the multitudes of cheaper options available, and bought hundreds of tiles. I cannot mix these tiles with the ones I already have, because they DO NOT MATCH. I am an unhappy customer with this set.",negative,negative
Pokemon TCG: 3 Booster Packs – 30 Cards Total| Value Pack Includes 3 Blister Packs of Random Cards | 100% Authentic Branded Pokemon Expansion Packs | Random Chance at Rares & Holofoils,"This seller is promoting variety in the booster packs so I bought five orders and they were all Sun and Moon with a couple of Sword and Shield. The picture also promotes XY series packages and obviously there were none at all. I know rares are random, but to not have a single rare out of fifteen packs is extremely suspicious. I would avoid this seller in the future.",negative,negative

"UNO Family Card Game, with 112 Cards in a Sturdy Storage Tin, Travel-Friendly, Makes a Great Gift for 7 Year Olds and Up [Amazon Exclusive]","I love Phase 10, but this set from late 2020 has cheap, sticky cards that are difficult to shuffle. It shuffles in clumps. I thought getting the one with a tin would be a nicer set. Are there better decks? You have to shuffle at least 10 times per game, with a double-sized deck that already makes it more difficult, so this isn't a minor thing. And a poorly shuffled deck really impacts the game's ease and fairness.",neutral,neutral

The selfie settings are also extra fun. However, after two days it froze, wouldn’t even turn off, so after the battery ran out I plugged it in to charge and it refused to charge.

Czech Games Codenames: Duet - The Two Player Word Deduction Game,"This is version is ok. The original game is so fun and different from other games. I was really expecting this game to take a cool, different spin that made it just as fun but for two players. However, this game just adds a couple extra “death” words and both players have different maps. There are a total of 15 words you need to guess and each player has 9. I’ve found that there can be a high degree of overlap in your good words and your teammate’s good words as well as your “death” words and your teammate’s “death” words. I don’t think I would buy this again. I’d rather find a more interesting two player game",neutral,neutral

I'm big on creative play, so this makes me happy. Very pleased with the price, the durability so far (we've had them a week), and the selection of animals, plus the small flyer with the information about each species (I'm a natural history instructor). Just make the type bigger, please! :) I was skeptical about the fence and trees (really?) and those turned out to be an important part of the play experience.  I will buy these again for gifts!",positive,positive
"Kinetic Sand Scents, Ice Cream Treats Playset with 3 Colors of All-Natural Scented Sand and 6 Serving Tools","This is my first ever in 21 years on Amazon giving a one star review. This product smells so terribly bad. It will make you want to barf and I think some vomit would improve the smell. The vanilla is vanilla musk like dollar store perfume from the 80s! The chocolate smell is vaguely chocolate, but more like if you burped up carob and hot dogs together. The strawberry was the most stand-able and it was a strong plastic'ish strawberry smell. Combined they were an olfactory train wreck abomination. The toys themselves were OK. Ten solid minutes of fun, if you can plug your nose and play. Is that what they mean by plug and play? I put the sand outside for THREE DAYS and then left it out in the dining room for a week. My husband said he could smell it three rooms away! The dog pooped in the living room and that was an improvement. I finally had to throw the sand in the garbage. I wouldn't use it to scent a litter box, let alone a kids toy!

He loves Legos but gets frustrated when there are simple pieces missing from these kits.  For the money they should be packaged better, in my opinion.  When you go to pack 1, starting on page 1, the pieces should all  be in PKG ONE.  Instead you sometimes have to go open little packages in part 2 or 3.  Then the pieces tend to get mixed up or lost by the time you need PKG 2 or PKG 3.  Otherwise Lego kits are a great STEM learning and fun parent-kid activity.",neutral,neutral
ZMLM Rainbow Scratch Mini Art Notes - 125 Magic Scratch Note Off Paper Pads Cards Sheets for Kids Black Scratch Note Arts Crafts DIY Party Favor Supplies Kit Birthday Game Toy Gifts Box for Girls Boys,"Smaller than I expected, but very durable and heavy.

Melissa & Doug Rainbow Stamp Pad - 6 Washable Inks,"I love this!  Such a great idea to have multiple colors in one instead of buying multiple pads.  I got it for my 2 1/2 year old to use with some nice Thomas the train stamps I found at a thrift store, he mixed up all the colors but I just let him be creative and have fun.  If you're OCD this may not be for you, there's nothing separating the colors.  Also, my son got some ink on his pants and it will not come out.  No big deal, but something to be aware of.  All in all, it was good purchase & good price.  I'm a big fan of Melissa & Doug products!",positive,positive
"Monopoly Junior Board Game, Ages 5 and up (Amazon Exclusive)","I might like this version better than really monopoly. This is nice and short and a lot of fun to play with the kids. Real monopoly can literally take 12 hours. You can finish this game in maybe 30 min so as a parent, I’m much more inclined to start a game of monopoly junior. The original monopoly I only play once a year just because it takes sooo long. My five year old loves it, it’s not too complicated. She can easily understand the rules and there’s even a little math involved.",positive,positive

The 2 y.o. loves it but doesn't get the concept just yet. He calls it his phone lol but he LOVES to push the buttons. The rest love the walkie talkies and they love the flashlite function as well. Great size for small hands and great colors. My ONLY complaint is that the battery cover doesn't stay on if you brush up against it, which the kids kept doing. It may require duck tape inevitably 🤷🏻‍♀️ Otherwise, I love them",positive,positive

We built the tree together which added to the overall satisfaction. The tree itself is a bit wobbly, you have to be careful moving it around or things around it.

"LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box 10698 Build Your Own Creative Toys, Kids Building Kit (790 Pieces)","I am happy with this purchase but I wish that they would actually fill the box.  The box is sturdy and will be great for storing the toy when kids are not playing with them.  From a teaching perspective, these are great to foster engineering thinking in kids.  I prefer the miscellaneous blocks because it does not assign what they must become.  The kits have pieces that are so specific that they can really only be one thing.  Those are great for teaching to follow directions but lack creativity.  The colors are vibrant and the product is sturdy.  I guess the box leaves room for purchasing another kit so that you can store them together.",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Scoop and Stack Ice Cream Cone Magnetic Pretend Play Set,"My daughter gets very frustrated with this ice cream set up (she is 3 and understands how it should work). The magnets with the cone and the ice cream are very week and will fall off with the slightest tip.  The magnet on the ice cream scooper itself is very good and will hold the ice cream.  But that makes another problem when trying to transfer the ice cream from the scooper to the cone. I also wish the ice cream box was big enough to fit the scoopers and the cones for easy clean up, but that's probably too much to ask :)",negative,negative

"Mexican Train Dominoes Game in Aluminum Carry Case, for Adults, Families and Kids Ages 8 and up","I purchased this Cardinal Mexican Train Domino Game with Aluminum Case from TRIINKETS, ETC. and shipped by Amazon. There are actually 2 different sizes of dominos in this set as some are slightly thicker than others. When played on an slightly uneven tablecloth we can't see the difference. But on a glass tabletop it is evident. There are also marks that can't be removed on on the reverse side of 3 of the dominos and an indentation on one of them. There were 4 others that had marks that I was able to scrub off. I tried to contact the seller through Amazon a week ago but have received no response. I would have been happy to send only the defective dominos back for replacement. Now I will return the whole thing. I rarely have problems with quality or customer service for items I purchase on Amazon. But Trinkets Etc. is either not very aware of the quality of this Cardinal game or doesn't care. That said, the case is nice and we played Mexican Train with our friend's set over the holidays and it was a fun, addictive game. We were up until after 1:00 AM one morning playing. I wish out set of dominoes was as nice as theirs! I am posting photos of some of the defective dominos so you can see what I mean. I just added a second photo from another set from a second vendor, FSN, after I returned the first set. This set was even worse with 15 dominos with marks, indentations and color fluctuations. I tried to scrub off some of the marks and smudges but they are permanent.I will look for a different brand. Cardinal has poor quality control.",negative,negative

It comes very well packaged in a cute box and over all it is a great toy. Best part is that the little robot is rechargeable, battery last for a very long time, the remote uses 2 AA batteries, the robot sings three songs that are programmed in the remote, the eyes light up, really cute toy.

"Flipslide Game, Electronic Handheld Game | Flip, Slide, and Match the Colors to Beat the Clock - 4 Game Modes - Multiplayer Fun","I'm 42 years old and bought this for myself because I had so much fun playing with the one my nephew I had. I also have 2 kids (5 and 3) and they both enjoy the game too. They pretty much just play ""speed mode"" which times how fast you can do 10 moves, because it doesn't cause as much anxiety as the other modes. They're basically free to take as long as they need to complete it. This is great game with lots of reply value. It's fun to try the different games modes to switch things up, and also to try to beat your top scores. A word on volume. A lot of reviews say the volume doesn't work or ""went out"", but you can easily turn off the volume accidentally. As you twist through the available game modes, one of the modes is ""volume"" (obviously not really a game mode) and you can easily fumble this and then turn off volume. Once it's off, the device is completely muted and ""feels"" broken as you can't tell what you're doing, what mode you're on, etc. You can fix this by: - Turning off the device (hold down the middle button) - Turn it back on (tap middle button once) - Wait for it to turn on (lights are solid) - Twist one of the sides until the 4 center lights go white (this is volume mode) - Slide one of the sides to ""activate"" volume mode - Twist a side again to adjust volume - Enjoy! Sadly, after 2 years, the device isn't registering matches 100% of the time. We'll match up the lights correctly and that device doesn't recognize it's a match. We have to move the pieces to incorrect positions and back again, sometimes multiple times, to get it to trigger. I suspect the contacts are worn down, but honestly, we haven't played it THAT much in 2 years. I'd hoped it would last longer, but we certainly got $18 of value out of this over 2 years.",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Wooden Scoop and Serve Ice Cream Counter (28 pcs) - Play Food and Accessories,"My 3 year old saw a similar ice cream set at the dentist's office and loved it, so as a surprise, I bought this online for him. He absolutely loves it - and we play ice cream store every day now.  To my surprise, our newly minted 1 year old also loves this set.  She loves to play with all the pieces, will chew on them and takes everything out and puts everything back - literally she will sit there and keep herself entertained for 30 minutes. There was a very small sliver splintering off when I opened it, but I think they might have been due to shipping.  I removed it and used some sandpaper to smooth it off and it's totally fine.  I really like the fact that it's mostly wood and I have found that the way the ice cream connects to the cones and cup is really quite secure.  I wasn't sure how it would work well without magnets, but now I don't need to worry about magnets coming off or losing effectiveness. My only wish is that the six dollar bills that came with it were either laminated or some form of rubbery material (like the indestructable books) as opposed to regular paper as they tear easily. The 3 year old is careful, but even with careful handling, I actually accidentally tore one of the edges and I need to keep the 1 year old from eating them as she like to chew on paper.  I will probably end up taking the money away and replacing them with something else.  Or perhaps I will laminate them myself. Overall, good toy, great for creativity and motor skill development, not mostly plastic which is nice.",positive,positive
"2 Pack Cartoon Remote Control Cars - Police Car and Race Car - Radio Control Toys for Kids, Boys, & Girls - Each with Different Frequencies So Both Can Race Together - Gifts for Toddler Boys Ages 2-4",This is perfect for our almost 4 yo and 2 yo. The controls are easy with one forward button and a reverse/turning button. There are two problems which stop me from giving 5 stars: 1) the antennae on the controllers are not mounted very securely given the age the toy is made for and they have become loose within the first week. they are still functional at the moment but I am not holding out hope for them lasting more than 6 months. 2) They seem to short or are on a similar radio wave as something else near us since the cars seem to randomly go off on their own. i would advise storing them in the off position when they are not in use to extend the battery life of the cars.,neutral,neutral

Thought he might roll his eyes but he really loved it.  We all took turns trying to catch the little plastic balls.  It's not easy, though, we really struggled getting the balls, especially ones in the corners were hard to reach.  But that didn't stop us from having a lot of fun.  Music was loud but we duct-taped some cotton gauze over the speakers and it seemed to dull the noise just fine. Actually I thought the music made it more fun and festive. It really made his party memorable.  I'm sure I'll be bringing this out for future parties.  Highly enjoyed by both kids and adults.  I thought quality of machine was excellent for the price.  Highly recommend!",positive,positive

Casdon Dyson Ball | Miniature Dyson Ball Replica For Children Aged 3+ | Features Working Suction To Add Excitement To Playtime,"My son loves his vacuum!  And he bangs it around and it has yet to break or damage.  Very sturdy. The power is very low and I don't know if it's suppose to be that low.  One power button turns the suction and sound on.  The other power button turns the beads on that fly around which also has very little power to make the beads fly around.  But you can NOT run both together. So it's either noise or fun beads.  Also it says it suctions, but it has yet to suction anything.  It is battery powered but I'm shocked of how weak the power is.  Maybe there is something wrong with mine.",positive,positive

First, the cons: 1. messy: most kids 6-12 will NOT be able to finish it by themselves. Many adults probably won't either. The glue and string wrapping step is messy. The next step (wait for glue to dry and then take out the inflated balloon) is prone to mistakes that can easily ruin the entire piece. 2. not as beautiful: say you finally get it done (like us), and you put on the string lights. The string is short and by no means it can light up the entire structure. It looks ok but not that bright as the picture shows. pro: if you need some challenge to your craftmanship, you get it. Most children toys on Amazon are no-brain setup, this is on the other side of the spectrum. For this alone I give it 3 stars.",neutral,neutral

Tamagotchi Pix - Floral (Pink) (42901),"I’ve had the Tamagotchi Pix for about two months now. I do like this tamagotchi, however I do agree with others on how it could have been better. So, here’s my long review if you want to read about my experience 😅 There is no marrying Tamas to each other and no genetics to deal with so it might be a con if you really liked that from previous versions. Will say the Tamagotchi Pix is less needy than the Tamagotchi On. In this tamagotchi, you spend all your time raising a single tama which is pretty normal. Now on the seventh day, your tama will want you to create an album with pictures and leave. They will go back to the Tamagotchi planet and send a different egg for you to raise next. You can decorate your room and place items in it which is neat. You can paint the items certain colors. However, to get more colors you need to use the camera. To be honest can’t say I care about the camera function. The camera quality is pretty crap and can’t pick up colors too well. You can use it to “cook” for your tama in game too. I usually laugh on seeing what the food I take pictures of turn into because sometimes it makes no sense. The Tamagotchi Pix does have tons of minis games to play. The play icon on the main screen has two minis games that don’t give gotchi points but makes the tama happy. Each day the arcade rotates between the three themes: leisure, nature, and sports. Two games are available for each theme. They do give points. Once your tama grows into an adult a door will open up. This room is called the training room where your Tama can train to be a pro in a certain job. To get to this room, swipe to the left twice. A con in my opinion are the touch buttons. At first, I felt like they suck and aren’t as responsive as you want sometimes. It can be annoying. But to give this tamagotchi a fair chance I got use to the touch buttons. I also recommend rechargeable batteries for the tamagotchi. Depending on how often you interact with it you can get about 4-5 days max for the Pix",positive,positive

It is great as he and his dad can race all over the house or out on the driveway or anywhere else they take the cars.  This was just as advertised and a true hit!  Batteries for all components are in compartments that need to be unscrewed with a very small screwdriver.  Other than that, very easy to set up and very easy to use.

"Crayola Ultra Clean Washable Markers, Broad Line Markers, Gifts, 40 Classic Colors","Out of all the markers I have tried, these give the best variety of colors, the boldest and brightest colors as well as clean lines while drawing. The caps are difficult for some children and some children dull out the tips because they press too hard but otherwise the children love them too! They are skinny but it is not a fine point marker. In comparison to other Crayola markers, it is a nice middle between the fine tip and the standard size markers. I love the range of colors you get, some fluorescent, neon, metallic, pastel, primary and intermediate colors. The ink seems to last about as long as cheaper brand standard size markers. They don't have enough ink to completely color an entire piece of poster board with one color, but an entire box can last through a coloring book.",positive,positive

Hasbro Gaming Guess Who? Game Original Guessing Game for Kids Ages 6 and Up for 2 Players,We bought this game already knowing what it was and how to play. But we needed a game for our youngest to be able to play on our family game night. This is one that is easy for even smaller children to be able to play very easily.

Hanes Men's Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt Value Pack (4-pack),"Summary: I use these shirts daily, so they get washed often. Although the shirts are hardly abused, they pretty much last about 3 months before holes appear in random places, mostly in the armpit area. I bleach them occasionally, but not with every wash. I purchased lrevious versions of this shirt and they lasted 2-3 years. The newer version shrinks a lot and is thinner. Pros: 1) The shirts fit reasonably well. 2) Only moderate shrinkage. 3) The seams are made well, no unravelling in my experience. Cons: 1) Lasts less than a year with regular use. 2) Holes can appear randomly. Suggestions: 1) It seems better to fold these shirts after drying. When I used hangars to put them in the closet, the neck area stretched.",neutral,positive

Czech Games Codenames,"We are always looking for good group games, and this one is great because you can have a variable amount of people and can play with a pretty good-sized crowd. Also, for people who are not into strategy board games, this is a crowd-pleaser. It is very easy to explain to people and to jump right in and play. Also, because you shuffle the deck, you can play endlessly and not run out of variety (like with Taboo). It is also is great for promoting teamwork and creativity, and gives opportunity for lots of laughs as you try to comprehend how another's brain works.",positive,positive

Cards Against Humanity,"Was introduced to this game by a group of friends while we camped out in front of a theater waiting for the opening showing. It doesn't take long too get the hang of it, and you are really only limited by your own personal 'whimsy'...or some might say 'sick sense of humor'.  It's a funny, often raunchy, easily surreal game that pushes the boundaries (okay, it breaks them) of 'good taste'. If you haven't played, and you have any 'wicked' in your sense of humor, I'd suggest taking a look at this. If you are ""PC"", easily offended, way down at the end of the far right or left of any scale, well, then I'd suggest you curl up with a good (?) reality TV show or your favorite 'agrees with you 100%' news broadcaster and leave this 'offensive' game to those of us who can laugh at the adult version of MadLibs. I liked the game so much, I had to come here to buy it. That's my recommendation ;)",positive,positive

They are fun. He put them all in one of those large black containers with the yellow lid from Costco and they all fit. After filling the container with about 1/4 of water they stopped growing. They are small marble sized balls. They were fun to play with. My 4 year old enjoyed running his hands through them. They are good for sensory play for half an hour or so, but as with most other toys, my kids were over it in less than 24 hours. They started to smell weird. And we just ended up throwing them away.",neutral,neutral

I have a pair of Motorola walkie talkies and these compare nearly identically at about half the price. I got these specifically for my kids to use. They haven't used up the battery life yet (about 25% left) and they have probably been used around 8 hours. The range on these is pretty good. My only complaint is that there's something goofy going on with one of the units. It keeps resetting the channel. My kids are 4 and 6 and can't figure out how to program the channels on their own, so we have to help them just about every time they go to use them.",positive,positive

"Exploding Kittens - A Russian Roulette Card Game, Easy Family-Friendly Party Games - Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids - 2-5 Players","As far as the playability and entertainment of this game, I give it 5 stars However, My son was ver excited to receive this game and we did not end up with what we thought we were getting.  This is why I give 2 stars We looked at all the buying options and decided the party pack was the best way to go.  It appeared it was going to come with the exploding kittens pack plus the imploding kittens expansion and 10 new cards.  While there are a few different cards to the original exploding kittens game, our pack did not come with the imploding kittens card, double slap, or the reverse card.  All which were shown on the included pictures for the order.  My son had his heart set on these special cards, so now I have spent $30 for a card game and have an upset 10 year old wanting to spend an extra $15 for the imploding kittens expansion that appeared was included.  The game is very fun and we love to play.  This is why we ordered it and were very excited to receive it.  I am just upset that we did not receive what it looked like we were paying for $45 seems a little heavy for a card game",negative,negative

"Funko Five Nights at Freddy's Articulated Foxy Action Figure, 5""",I bought this and a couple other Funko 5 in Freddy figures. The detail in this one and the others are really great and the quality of the materials seem good as well. The one thing that prompted 3 stars is the connector design for the arms/legs..ect. They are not tightly secure enough which allows them to detach easily during play. After this happening a few times it became less desirable to play with for my son having to put it back together. The way it is set up eventually the ball socket will loosen and most likely wont stay attached at all. To be honest I did read other reviews that said the same but thought since my son was a bit older and not as rough playing that it would be okay.,neutral,neutral

"Cephalofair Games Gloomhaven: Jaws of The Lion Strategy Boxed Board Game for ages 12 & Up , Brown","Never played the original Gloomhaven, but now I definitely want to. This game is so fun and each scenario takes about an hour to complete, including game set up. This is for two players. Gameplay time might take longer for more people. The thing I love about it, and something a lot of other reviewers have mentioned, is how perfectly it walks you through the basics. The first 5 scenarios are to walk you through the basics and it REALLY makes sure you understand what you need. Super fun. When I can afford the big $100 gloomhaven or the frosthaven (whenever that comes out), I’ll be making this purchases thanks to this",positive,positive

Maybe, but most of the time a bit longer.  Box also says for 2 to 5 players, but I don't see why you couldn't play with any number! I laminated 10 score cards (you can get 5 in one paper sized laminating sheet) and bought a 6 pack of ""Gear + Pen"" brand white board markers with the eraser ends, and now have reusable score cards, because the replacements are expensive.  The yellow marker doesn't show up, so I don't take it, but everything, including 5 markers fits in the nifty little box.  Great for the RV!",positive,positive

They enjoy how easy it is to just start building with them and that the possibilities are endless. One small drawback is that the edges can bend back a bit, causing the spokes to break off. Overall, this item has been a hit in my room. It also has helped bring students who struggle socially together. Many of my students struggle with making friends, but their creations with this product have become conversation starters and encouraged them to work together to build bigger and more involved creations. Excellent item!",positive,positive

The ideal game for fun, entertaining and exciting hours of play with friends and family.","This was a Christmas gift, but I had the opportunity to play it.  It was a fun game, using memory, strategy, and math skills.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I felt the instructions were difficult to understand, more than likely due to the translation.  I played with a 9 and 11 yr. old., who read the instructions aloud.  For example, the instructions weren't clear as to whether one or two decks should be used.  We all enjoyed playing!",positive,positive

"Crayola Ultra Clean Washable Markers, Fine Line Marker Set, Gift for Kids, 40 Count","I was so excited for these markers because of the variety of colors. My toddler was using the “pip squeaks” shorter version but the ink started running out on all of them since she colors so much, so I though my this would be a good alternative giving her the skinnier shape but longer so more ink. But I didn’t realize that the tip of these markers is so tiny. It would be better for drawing. Or for older kids.",neutral,neutral

My 4.5 year old is wanting to play this pretty much every single day. It’s easy to play and even after playing is constantly it never gets old. He loves to play this more with multiple people to make it more competitive rather than just with two people. The mechanism that releases the tiles does get stuck every once in awhile. It also spits out four tiles sometimes. So it is kind of frustrating not knowing if it is going to work right. However it hasn’t stopped us from playing.,positive,positive
"70 PCS Cutting Play Food Toy for Kids Kitchen, Pretend Fruit &Vegetables Accessories with Shopping Storage Basket, Plastic Mini Dishes and Knife, Educational Toy for Toddler Children Birthday Gift","Gave these to our daughter for her 2nd birthday and she LOVES them. She very quickly figured out how to cut all the food pieces and then she matches them all back up which is a great learning skill too! I love the corn, banana and peas and how they ""peel"" or ""shell"" like the real thing. These are a little trickier for her to figure out how to put back together, but it adds a nice extra challenge to the set! Also these are very sturdy, hard plastic and the attention to detail inside the pieces is great too! Very nice set for a great price!",positive,positive
Hasbro Gaming Trouble Board Game for Kids Ages 5 and Up 2-4 Players,"In this day and age of video games and cell phone apps, it is great to be able to go to one of the retro games from my childhood and show the young kids how much fun it was. This game is great because you can learn the rules in a few minutes and the set up is a cinch. Just put your colored pegs in the correct color coded slots and you are ready for the best part of the game- the popper. I used to love the satisfying click of pushing it and seeing the dice tumble. Getting that number you need is a tiny thrill or getting to send an opponent back is worth a laugh or two. I love this old fashioned game and appreciate that we can still buy it. It will hold up well for a whole new generation to play and love. This would be a great game to take along on camping trips if the kids get bored or need some down time.",positive,positive

Fisher-Price See ‘n Say the Farmer Says [Amazon Exclusive],"The media could not be loaded. Extremely disappointed in this order. First off, as soon as I opened the package, I could clearly tell that it was not new as it was described and I was expecting. My husband as well as my aunt, took one look at it and said it was definitely used. There are black marks in multiple places on the product and scratches all of the back on the item. This was intended to be a birthday gift, but there is no way I'm going to be gifting this to anyone. When you pull the lever, it stops on an animal and is obviously supposed to make the noise of that animal so children can learn what noise they make. Well it lands on a cat and makes the noise of a turkey. So if you want your child to learn incorrect animal noises.... perfect. It says it's an Amazon Exclusive, but Amazon definitely cannot help you with a replacement or troubleshooting, so call the manufacturer. Cannot stress enough that we are extremely disappointed in this product. DO NOT BUY. I was also expecting it to be much larger like the one I knew growing up. I would give zero stars if I could.",negative,negative

"Pressman Mancala - Real Wood Folding Set, with Multicolor Stones by Pressman",The box represents marble-like gem game pieces.  What I received were plastic beads with holes on either end.  They appear to be beads that should be strung together. Although it is just a boardgame I'm disappointed. I intentionally purchased a wood and glass marble game because I did not want another cheap plastic game.,negative,negative

"Crayola My First Safety Scissors, Toddler Art Supplies, 3ct","I bought crayola specifically to make sure the scissors were high quality, yet the product came with the exact flaw that I was afraid of. The two blades do not meet all the way at the top of any of the three pairs of scissors, so my kid cannot cut anything. If the goal of this product is teach your kids how to cut things and to be safe, it misses both marks.",negative,negative
"2 Pack Cartoon Remote Control Cars - Police Car and Race Car - Radio Control Toys for Kids, Boys, & Girls - Each with Different Frequencies So Both Can Race Together - Gifts for Toddler Boys Ages 2-4","Fun gift for my 2 yr old. He loves to play with these. Each car makes it's own sounds and the little people can be removed. They are pretty durable because he will kick it back to the upright position if it falls over. He keeps grabbing it by the antenna and it has held up. We turn off the cars after use and the battery life has held up. The remote controllers do not have an on off switch. All of us enjoy playing with these and crashing into the other. My 11 and 8 year old even ask for a turn. This is fun time with the family. Also, when needing to reverse, it reverses to one side only.",positive,positive

My daughter also had a camera like this when she was younger and we always liked to see what pictures she would take and what she saw meaningful at the age of four! This camera is very similar to the one that we previously had. It’s a little bit smaller, but for us this is perfect since we are giving it to you at three-year-old. The first picture is the camera and my daughters hand and the second one is my hand to show the size. I also love that it creates puzzles out of the pictures that you take and it also has a little filters on it for birthdays and holidays!!!",positive,positive
"Melissa & Doug Drawing Paper Pad (9 x 12 inches) - 50 Sheets, 3-Pack","I bought this for my son to practice his graffitti lettering (he uses markers). A little thinner than I thought. Disappointed that the paper bleeds through when using markers. I'm going to rip out the cardboard backing from a notebook so he can put between the drawing pad sheets, so that way when he's using the markers it won't bleed through. Next time, I'll be ordering a different brand.",neutral,neutral
"Crayola My First Safety Scissors, Toddler Art Supplies, 3ct","These scissors are marketed as ""my first safety scissors"", but I would not recommend these for any young kiddos beginning to learn how to use scissors. They simply pinch and maybe tear the paper at best unless you use them like an adult would use scissors (IE opening them all the way, placing the paper way towards the back and smoothly close/glide onto the next cut). Do they work? Technically, yes. Did my daughter get *extremely* frustrated because they were making cutting paper significantly more difficult than it should ever be? Yes. Did I toss these in the trash the day after I bought them and grab regular rounded edge scissors from the dollar tree? Also yes. Would I recommend these to anybody ever? Absolutely not. Definitely pass, get regular scissors and just closely supervise. It will save your child a ton of frustration and discouragement.",negative,negative
Cards Against Humanity: Nasty Bundle • 6 Themed Packs + 10 New Cards,"A lot smaller then I imagined & the cards that say theres extra came with 3 thick cardboard pieces to fill up the box to make it look full, definitely was a disappointment cause it should of been full deck of cards, other then that, the picture ones are great & totally nasty vibes 😎😜 Adult game only",negative,negative
Melissa & Doug Cutting Fruit Set - Wooden Play Food Kitchen Accessory,"Whoever thought of this was awesome!  I bought this for my 4 year old daughter.  We've only had it for a few days and she has played with it non stop.  I think it is a pretty well made set. Packaging:  The set comes in a wooden tray with the sides about 2 inches tall and pretty well made.  The fruit sits in molded plastic holding each piece separate. The bottom of the tray has a picture of hay.  I took the plastic out so its easier for my daughter to take care of it, she can just put all the pieces in the tray. Knife:  Good imitation wooden knife.  It's about 8 inches long and shaped like a butcher knife. Fruit:  Set comes with a strawberry, pear, kiwi, cantaloupe, melon, orange, and lemon.  They are made of solid wood, and the pictures/colors on them are painted on, not stickers.  The pieces of fruit are held together by velcro that is inset in the center of each piece.  The velcro is white and it about the size of a nickel.  I think the velcro could be larger on some of the bigger pieces of fruit (the pear for instance) to hold it together better, but what it has does do the trick. When cutting the fruit, it does imitate real cutting.  My daughter actually has to put ""work"" into it to get them cut. As far as durability, I really can't say as we've only had it a week.  I can see the velcro eventually giving out, but that would be an easy fix. I would recommend this product as I know it will give my daughter several years of fun!",positive,positive
"70 PCS Cutting Play Food Toy for Kids Kitchen, Pretend Fruit &Vegetables Accessories with Shopping Storage Basket, Plastic Mini Dishes and Knife, Educational Toy for Toddler Children Birthday Gift",This is such a great gift for children of almost all ages!

I'd have to tie knots in every single one before he wears it, which means opening every single package ahead of time. They are nice, lightweight masks and he likes the colors, but the straps are definitely too long to wear them without shortening first. The box also came completely destroyed.",negative,negative

"Obuby Toys for 3-12 Year Old Boys Walkie Talkies for Kids 22 Channels 2 Way Radio Gifts Toys with Backlit LCD Flashlight 3 KMs Range Gift Toys for Age 3 up Boy and Girls to Outside , Hiking, Camping","We originally purchased a pair for our family. Then we purchased the 3 pack as a birthday gift. There's one sound that you can't turn down. I think the pager? 5hat is so annoying because the kids hit it all the time. For the older kids it was easy to show them how to use it, and they loved it! The toddlers took a bit longer to catch on, but not a huge deal. We've only tried a .25 mile range. Haven't had it long enough to try further, but sound is fine. My issue is we opened them up and the pink one gave us issues from the start. Very difficult place batteries in and turn on. Finally get it working and it was dropped. It immediately stopped working. We removed the batteries and put them back in, but it wouldn't come back on. Again, we have at this point 4 others and they were dropped and just fine. Very disappointed because we hadn't had this problem with the others and you'd expect these to be able to handle being dropped if it's a kid toy.",negative,positive

Melissa & Doug Let's Play House! Grocery Cans Play Food Kitchen Accessory - 10 Stackable Cans With Removable Lids,"These are so cool. They open and are stiff enough for toddlers to play with and not ruin. The lids all fit in tight enough to hide things in there and play, but easy enough for a 3 year old to open. We try to find plastic foods to match and put them in, which makes it fun. Kids are funny and will put other things in that are supposed to be in can foods, and laugh. They stack nice and look ""real"" to engage pretend play.",positive,positive
PicassoTiles 2 Piece Car Truck Construction Kit Toy Set Vehicle Educational Magnet Building Tile Magnetic Blocks Puzzle Magnets Toys with Re-Enforced Hitch and Long Bed for Girls Boys Toddler Ages 3+,"I recently purged my 3yo daughter's toy closet and wanted to be more mindful of what we replaced her old toys with. Many of the toys were items she maybe played with 5-10 minutes, and too often ended up in an untouched pile on the floor. I was looking for toys that would 1) encourage imaginative play and 2) entertain for longer then 5-10 minutes and 3) be harmless to my 9mo. These were an absolutely PERFECT investment! These tiles been played with daily, multiple times a day, for lengthy periods of time :) My daughter has crafted everything from towers to pizzas with them and daily creates a new pattern or shape that she is eager to show me. I actually enjoy playing with them myself ;) Would buy again with zero hesitation!",positive,positive
Melissa & Doug Food Groups - 21 Wooden Pieces and 4 Crates,"I bought this set about a month ago for my 22 month old to go to expand his play kitchen food selection. They’ve become one of his favorite toys and he plays with them daily.  We have hard floors and two dogs who have occasionally tried to carry a piece or two off, so in other words, the pieces get banged around quite a bit, and the paint hasn’t chipped or rubbed off at all. I also love the little milk crates for storing and sorting, they help keep all the pieces neatly organized when not in use.",positive,positive

Ticket to Ride Board Game | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Train Game | Ages 8+ | For 2 to 5 players | Average Playtime 30-60 minutes | Made by Days of Wonder,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes boardgames. After we played this a few times, I also got pretty into the gameplay and purchased the euorpe version for myself. Overall, the game is fast paced and is mostly driven by strategy and a bit of luck associated with drawing train cards. Pros - from my understanding this is the orginial ticket to Ride game with the basic gameplay rules and mechanics. The us cities are spread across the map, making it easier to read and follow for New comers. - there are a blend of long and short routes that ensures a wide variety of strategies at play to successfully complete the destination tickets - the board itself is sturdy and I am not too worried about bending the cardboard Cons - the train and destination cards are small compared to the ones that are provided in the Europe iteratuon. Tickets are small enough to make it a bit difficult to hold onto. - once you play the expansion maps with the addition mechanics of tunnels, ferries and so forth the basic USA map included in this package can feel a bit too simple. I suggest starting with this USA version, before jumping onto the newer Europe based map collections",positive,positive

"Safari Animals Figures Toys, Realistic Jumbo Wild Zoo Animals Figurines Large Plastic African Jungle Animals Playset with Elephant, Giraffe, Lion, Tiger, Gorilla for Kids Toddlers, 12 Piece Gift Set","This product is pretty cheaply made with awful detail in the painting. You can see where the two halves of the animal have been melded together, and the colors of the animals are pretty monochromatic. It seems like they had a small handful of colors to choose from. The moose can’t stand and the rest of the animals are lightweight and flimsy. Will be returning",negative,negative
Melissa & Doug Super Smile Dentist Kit With Pretend Play Set of Teeth And Dental Accessories (25 Toy Pieces),"I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's super fun.  It has a vibrating base that is interchangeable into the drill and polish brush making it seem realistic.  The molars even lift up making it like you can pull them out.  The polish cup lids pop on and off easily even for my 23 month old.  The sticker are a nice touch so it looks like you are fixing the bugs/cavities out of the teeth. They do come off easily but are still fun.  My 8 year old and 23 month old love playing this together.",positive,positive

"Bluey Mega Bundle Home, BBQ Playset, and 4 Figures | Amazon Exclusive","I ordered this item after Christmas, and since it arrived, my four year old has lost all interest in her Christmas gifts - all she wants to do is play Bluey from wake up to bed time. Sometimes we reenact episodes of the show, and sometimes she makes up stories all on her own. My daughter is absolutely obsessed. For that alone, I would order this toy again 100 times. My biggest complaint is the fold-up part. On ours, it does not fold up and stay locked in place. I've tried to finagle it every which way. But unless I take out the duct tape, it is not staying closed. That means the fold up part and the carrying handle are basically useless for us. It isn't a deal breaker, as we definitely love this set regardless, but I would like it even more if it clipped closed the way it's supposed to. Edit: I figured it out... I had the fold up part backwards. Oops!",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Butterfly and Heart Wooden Stamp Set: 8 Stamps and 2-Color Stamp Pad,"I bought this for my little girl who just turned 4.  The stamps are nice, have held up pretty well.  They are about the size of a quarter if I had to guess.  The mark down on the rating was because of the ink pad.  From the first opening of the package, the ink was VERY light (even on white paper).  There is no point to use it-- i'd be better of purchasing a 'real' ink pad.  It is packaged in a pink wood box and wrapped in plastic.  I like the box as it seems sturdy, but the downfall with it is there is no cover.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this because the ink pad stinks.",neutral,neutral

Fisher-Price Little People Animal Friends,"These animals, although in Fisher Price packaging, are cheap knock-offs in my opinion.  Apparently Fisher Price has decided that quantity and their bottom dollar is more important than quality, where having them made cheaper overseas at a reduced quality is acceptable.  They don't even seem to be one whole animal, but put together in a couple pieces, which concerns me that my grandson could pull a piece off and choke on it. I used to think Fisher Price meant a good, quality products.  Not anymore!",negative,negative
"LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box 10698 Build Your Own Creative Toys, Kids Building Kit (790 Pieces)","This is a great basic set.  It inspires creativity since it does not build just 1 thing.  Though your child has to be interested in building before this makes sense.  I love the bright colors.  The box is about 1/2 full, so there is plenty of room for more.  It really has a ton of pieces in it. Many are quite small so I'm sure some have been lost with my 3 1/2 year old playing with it.

Caucasian 11-inch Small Soft Body Baby Doll | JC Toys - La Baby | Washable |Removable Pink Outfit w/ Hat & Blanket | For Children 12 Months +,"I purchased La Baby 11” as a Birthday gift for my one year old granddaughter and she carries “my baby” most of her waking hours. She wouldn’t let go of her, tucking this precious baby doll under her arm while we all sang “Happy Birthday” and took her first bites of cake. ❤️ When I opened this package when it arrived at my home, it was confirmed that this was the same first baby doll my two daughters had when they were toddlers. We named theirs “blue baby” and “pink baby” based on their outfits and I just might still have them, packed away for the day when my daughters became mommas. Very well made with easy to remove play suit that closes with Velcro like tabs. The pacifier is strongly connected and can be pushed into the doll’s mouth. The soft molded head has a realistic appearance; the hands and feet are realistic, too. The soft body is what makes this doll so easy to carry by 12 month old little hands. I strongly recommend this as a first baby doll for little ones; older toddlers and children will also love this doll.",positive,positive

Disney Princess Dress Up Trunk Deluxe 21 Piece [Amazon Exclusive],"This is an adorable set.  They are not, as others have said, a set of high-quality clothes that one would wear in place of regular clothes.  They are for inside, dress-up play.  For that, and given the reasonable cost, we have loved them.  Our 2.5 yr old adores them and wants us to put them on her all the time.  They are big for her, but totally wearable.  They should last for some time, though they will show wear given her horsing around in them.  These are a great buy!",positive,positive
Hasbro Gaming Trouble Board Game for Kids Ages 5 and Up 2-4 Players,"This game is surprisingly sturdy, although the bubble is a little stiff and doesn't always pop the dice the best it is such a godsend for small tables as opposed to throwing dice.

Got for our 1st grade class at midweek church - we had teachers stopping by to tell us we'd given the gift of the year! Then we had lots of kids from different classes begging for one! The price is great, although I was disappointed that Amazon's 2 day shipping actually took 7 days and I got them the DAY OF the party...was a little nervous about that! We have bought 40ish pens so far, and I have had a couple that the light didn't work and a few that the button to turn the light on was too hard for a kid to do...but overall, have been great.

I homeschool and wanted another sensory activity for my toddler, I guess. But when I went to make them, it was just kind of more of hassle than anything. They roll and bounce EVERYWHERE if you are using a shallow tub for them, so try to put them in something deep. My son who is 1, puts everything in his mouth, so it worried me that they could disappear so easily to be found by him later. I can picture many fun hours of play for my kids with these later, but until I don't have a crawler around the house, I won't be using them. Gave away this pack after one use because picking up small beads off the floor all day isn't something I want to be doing.",neutral,neutral

Don't Break the Ice Game,"I bought this game for my 2.75 year old. I had this game as a kid and wanted to share the fun experience with my child. This new game functions very similarly, but has two flaws in its newer design: 1. The penguin character doesn’t seat very well into his block with the slot so it’s much easier to accidentally knock him off his ice cube. 2. The legs come off the table too easily and can be frustrating to set up, since they don’t click into place. Other than those frustrations, this is still a fun game and lots of fun to play. I recommend!",positive,positive

Hasbro Gaming: Jenga Classic Game,"So we love Jenga in our house and wanted a new set after we lost some of the other pieces. Oddly, however, this comes in a box that is not the same size as the game so you can't easily store it stacked up in the box. And the thing that is supposed to be used to keep it in shape in between games and to set it up right is no longer hard plastic but cheap cardboard, so it is not going to last very long (with a house full of kids) so there won't be an easy way to re-set the game up without the thing that keeps it i the right shape. Our old Jenga game had a nice plastic thing to keep the shape of the game and then a box that was the size of the game so it could be easily stored in the box in between games. For a game with a million pieces, it makes no sense to not think about how people will store it and set it up. I'm sure it is a cost-saving thing and marketing thing, but if you can buy one with a smaller box so you can easily store it and keep its shape in between games. Of course the game is great as always.",positive,positive

What Do You Meme? Core Game - The Hilarious Adult Party Game for Meme Lovers,"This game is NOT intended for children or young teens. The cards are packaged so a separate ""adult"" set is discretely hidden from the bulk of the caption cards, but I still found some caption cards mentioning alcohol and sexual suggestions. Recommended for at least ages 16+ but really this game is meant for college-age/adults. Your experience may vary; I am only reviewing the core package and I do not own any of the expansions yet. This game could easily be played with teens if someone wanted to sort through the caption cards and remove the few that are less-appropriate for ages 13-16. If you are an adult playing with other adults ages 18-30s, this game is hysterical and is a fantastic party game! You will cry with laughter, it will hurt and it will be great.",positive,positive

We went through 4 yes 4 sinks in 2 months. Each sink lasts about 2-3 uses and then the motor dies. We did a regular return for the fist one but when it died again I reached out to the company. I asked if this was a common problem and if it was  worth replacing. Without any explanation they said they got approval to replace the item. Keep in mind the item has a 90 day warranty. 2 uses later this sink died too. My kids love this thing so when it dies after 2 or 3 uses with brand new batteries and pulling the motor out in between uses its so frustrating. I reached out to the company again in disbelief their highly rated item could be so faulty. I explained that the motor keeps burning out although they admitted they frequently replace sinks for their customers they said they usually don't have to replace it more than once.  Next they emailed me saying they would send another unit as a favor but asked that I film a YouTube video showing the problem with the broken sinks.  In my next email explained there's no way I would make a YouTube video but I would send them back the units so they could check it out themselves. They ended up processing a refund which is a shame because it's a great concept if only they could make their product work. Save yourself the time and your kids the disappointment.,negative,negative
Hasbro Game of Life Junior,Bought this for my 5 year old son who loves board games. We play the regular version and thought this was more age appropriate. It’s very basic though and with only 48 adventure cards he already knows what all of them are after 1 round. He enjoys going through them for now but I don’t see this being interesting long term.,neutral,neutral
SKIP BO Card Game,"We have a women's card playing club and can wear out a set of Skip Bo cards because we play so much and so long.  These will replace ones I bought about a year ago.

I like the variety of animals that are included in the set (koala, meerkat, gorilla, panda).  The fence is easy to put together and the grass is fine although my kids isn't interested in those things right now.  This isn't a super high quality set but it is fun to play with right now.  I had hoped they were a little bigger but I should have paid attention to the description!  Great colors and the number of animals included is good.",positive,positive
"PicassoTiles 100 Piece Set 100pcs Magnet Building Tiles Clear Magnetic 3D Building Blocks Construction Playboards, Creativity Beyond Imagination, Inspirational, Recreational, Educational Conventional","I was very hesitant as first when comparing the reviews & the Picasso Tiles to the Magna Tiles. I must say these tiles are vibrant colored, seem to be made well & a great purchase for the price. It came in a nice box & was packaged well. I bought these because of the amount of pieces you get for the price as compared to manga tiles. I must admit the magnatiles have a bit stronger magnet therefore they hold a little better but the cost of those are a lot more. It’s been a week of playing with Picasso tiles and everything is still in tact. They have gotten a few dings here and there. But overall my child really likes these tiles. I’m glad I got the 100 pieces because it’s perfect for building a nice sized house - not too little & not too much.  They keep my child busy & creative for a while, especially when you throw other toys in the mix! I highly recommend these Picasso tiles, I would buy more & would even gift them to someone else!",positive,positive
Melissa & Doug Food Groups - 21 Wooden Pieces and 4 Crates,"I run a daycare and we are trying to reduce environmental toxins (including plastic). I am replacing all plastic toy food with wooden ones. I purchased wooden play food from Melissa and Doug, Hape and Plan toys. The Melissa and Doug set immediately started chipping- the ""hamburger"" came with bubbled up paint. Within a couple of minutes of being played with for the first time, the paint peeled off, revealing a thick, white, powdery substance underneath, that came off on the child's hands. What is the powder?  I don't know because when I emailed M&D a couple weeks ago to ask, no one ever responded! Only the hamburger is totally destroyed, but I think it is safe to assume that if one toy comes apart within minutes of use, the rest of the set won't last long. I have had no problems thus far with the food from Hape or Plan Toys. We have other toys from M&D- puzzles and such that are ok. However this toy was so low quality I am hesitant to try another of their products. We asked for an exchange- we will see if this was a fluke or not. I see that many other reviewers have had paint issues as well, though.",negative,negative

"Star Wars The Child Animatronic Edition 7.2-Inch-Tall Toy by Hasbro with Over 25 Sound and Motion Combinations, Toys for Kids Ages 4 and Up , Green","I have a household obsessed with “baby yoda” but it’s my 5 year old that was deemed worthy to get this for Christmas (at least he watches Star Wars & The Mandalorian and doesn’t mistake him for “baby groot” like his siblings do).....I preordered it and received it with plenty of time to spare, however it wasn’t secured inside the box. I figured maybe it just accidentally came loose, until took it out of the clear plastic packaging. The feet weren’t attached and were loose in the packaging as well, it only had a single battery (it was missing two). The doll was completely detached from the box, the box that looked as if it took a serious beating to get here. I did test it out and within a few seconds I forgot all about the defective packaging because the animatronics are the cutest thing EVER! I’m telling you, this might be small BUT it is mighty in its adorableness. Personally I think it’s worth EVERY penny. Will it be a toy my kid plays with 24/7? Of course not, but it will be a favorite present this year I guarantee it!",positive,positive

Even after getting it assembled as soon aas you move it to play with you can expect at least one piece to fall off.

Windy City Novelties LED Light Up and Walking Realistic Dinosaur with Sound,This was a hit with the four year old.  It was smaller than I though (my fault as I didn't look at directions) but perfect size and everyone enjoyed the light up and walking figure...except for the small dogs.  The roar was quite loud and non stop and I can see at some point the parents removing batteries for a while and mentioned that some of the reviews mentioned this - but the 4 year old loved this and loved pointing it toward a younger sibling to torment as older siblings must do.  But once the younger sibling gets to play with it on his own - doubt this effect will last!,positive,positive

I love that they were sold in a set of 3 because we do a lot of camping and plan on using them as a family. I noticed, like others had pointed out in the reviews, that when I opened the cover for the ear jack that there was not an ear jack piece there. However, after carefully reading the product information again, it does say the ""earpiece is NOT included"", which must be what they mean but it is a little confusing. However, this is of no concern to us though because we did not plan on using that feature anyway. Bottom line, great product, great quality, great sound, great range, easy to use!  WE LOVE THEM!!

"Monopoly Game: Ultimate Banking Edition Board Game, Electronic Banking Unit, Game for Families and Kids Ages 8 and Up (Amazon Exclusive)","I want to be clear: This is not the full Monopoly experience. There are no mortgages. Chance and Community Chest have been combined to a single Event card. Railroads and utilities are removed. You no longer build properties up with houses and hotels, but rather rent is influenced by game events. The games ends when the first player goes bankrupt, not when there is only a single player standing. I was expecting the full Monopoly game with an electronic banking system. I got a Monopoly game with streamlined rules that ends relatively quickly. That being said, the streamlined game works well. Once you learn how to operate the electronic bank and which cards need to be scanned when, the game moves briskly along. You will be able to finish a number of games in the time it would have taken to play a single game of OG Monopoly. You're going to need to do a number of games, too, because this is 4 players max.",neutral,neutral
"Crayola Ultra Clean Washable Markers, Broad Line Markers, Gifts, 40 Classic Colors","We buy markers all the time it seems.  So far, these are the best crayola markers we have used to date, and they are consistently good (this is our third box).  We recently bought some of the regular boxes during the back to school specials, and found many of them to be dried out right out of the box.  These markers, however, last a long time, even when the lids are left off.  None seem to be dried out prematurely and there are tons of colors with really cool names.  Best of all, they are washable.  They are a little pricey, but in the end they are smaller than the regular markers (so take up less space) and last MUCH longer, so in my mind they are worth every penny.  Watch the prices before you buy though, they fluctuate a lot.  I have never paid over $10.00 for them, even though as I write this review they are listed for $13.79.",positive,positive

"Crayola Air Dry Clay, Natural White Modeling Clay, 5 Lb Bucket","I have tried several different types of air dry clay for my kids, and this has been their favorite. It feels more like ""real clay"" than most air dry clays do, and it hardens a little faster than others, as well. They like to paint it after it dries, and it absorbs just basic watercolor paint great. It was a better deal on Amazon than I could find at other retailers.",positive,positive

There was enough pens in the package that they each carried one home with them and had one to leave at my house for when they visit.. and a spare.  The pens are so easy to use. Write or draw something and only if you have the light, that is on the cap of the pen, can you see the invisible message.

Ticket to Ride Board Game | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Train Game | Ages 8+ | For 2 to 5 players | Average Playtime 30-60 minutes | Made by Days of Wonder,Great game...But we gave this to the kid who doesn't like to think ahead and only sees one way of doing things. Our mistake was to play the first time with 5 people. It took forever with that many people and figuring out how to play. It is not a difficult game but you do have to learn how to play it. We should have played the first time with 3 players and then I think he would have liked it. Once the game is learned it can be rather fast-paced. He has decided never to play again...but the rest of us love it and play often.,positive,positive

The robot switches on, but does not respond to any buttons on the remote control. Tried different batteries, etc. It's just not working. To add insult to injury, after you switch it on, it dances and eventually starts whining about ""Why don't you play with me?"" What a disappointment and a waste of money. If you don't want a disappointed kid, do not buy this. I would have given it a no-star rating.",negative,negative

The cars themselves have buttons that make noises so do not worry if they are not playing with them as they should initially, it will come with time.",positive,positive

When I showed my husband what I got him, I was happy to hear that this was a toy that little guy saw in the store too and had expressed interest in. But, when I finally got the package and opened up the box, I was surprised to see that it was all in parts that needed to be assembled. It looked like waayyyyy too much for a 3 year old. I put batteries in the drill and resigned myself to it being a toy that our little guy would be able to play with when he was older. I was so wrong. The morning after his birthday, my husband and son assembled the dinosaurs and little guy has been having a blast. The screws are the right depth, and easy to unscrew and re-screw. Key parts of the dinosaurs snap together so they can't be taken too much apart. The tools are a great size for toddler hands and easy for adults when little guy asks for help. There are a few spare screws as well. And, when assembled, he has dinosaurs to play with. This is a great gift for little kids.",negative,negative

I didn’t like the ball piece to make it Pivot the vacume almost bounces up and down aside from that really fun realistic toy.. suction could be a little better since it’s what makes this stand out from others it barley picks up a piece of hair.. but it’s fun to teach like I said and don’t expect it to work like an actual vacume.

Hanes Men's Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt Value Pack (4-pack),"Too many shirts these days seem to be made for very short people, so when I've ordered shirts just large enough to fit my 6-foot and large frame (XL fits my chest and shoulders), I have been stuck with shirts that left me with a bare midriff or came untucked with only the slightest movement. These shirts, though, are longer than some of the others I've had. They fit me nicely in all areas and tuck in well. Even while working out on machines or on projects around the house where I've had to reach high over my head, these shirts have stayed tucked in. I plan to buy more of these now that I know how they fit.",neutral,neutral

"Pressman Mancala - Real Wood Folding Set, with Multicolor Stones by Pressman","The board is real wood and even the hinge parts are wood, very nice.  Traditionally it seems the game is played using seeds as the pieces.  In this set the pieces provided are glass decorative or craft pieces that are very nice to handle, but the cups on the board easily get to overflowing. I tried playing with roasted coffee beans, but found them rather crumbly. I will try some other objects, such as dry beans or popcorn corn. I really like the board.

Melissa & Doug 20 Wooden Animal Magnets in a Box,"These magnets are really cute, and my one year-old loves playing with them. They've helped me teach him to identify different animals. There's a nice mix of farm and jungle animals. My only (major) gripe with them -- these aren't just wooden, as advertised. The animal prints are cardboard, and it doesn't have a protective coating. As soon as they get wet (washing, teething, etc.) the print starts to deteriorate. They need some laminate or modge podge or something to keep them looking pristine. This is a major oversight in the production of these magnets. Duh, y'all. ""Tested to be safe and durable"" … Horse puckey! Another reviewer (who convinced me) wrote: ""They are made of durable wood...just in case you have a nibbler. Hope this helps :) "" Don't believe the dead colon eyes or the manipulative, wide smile of the parenthese-mouth emoticon. LIES! ALL LIES! Behold; the truth:",negative,negative

So definitely convenient if you are waiting somewhere and need to keep kids busy. I bought them this year as a stocking stuffer and they are still fun, even for adults. I think the price is reasonable for what they are. I don't think you will get much use out of them, depending on what you create. When you go to pull the sticks apart for reuse, they will break if you twisted them hard enough.",positive,positive

SET Enterprises Five Crowns Card Game Purple,"An easy to learn game for 2-7 (if I remember correctly) people to play. Gave it to my girlfriend as part of our one year anniversary as it is a pastime we really enjoy as we both have been working hard in college. We first played it with her brother and sister-in-law and have loved it ever since. I recommend this game to anyone who likes a game that is 1 part skill, 1 part luck, and 1 part craftiness. For $10 bucks, this will be a better investment as entertainment than going to the movies will ever be (believe me, I love the movies). Finally, I don't think I'll ever find another game where someone who is new to the game can win their first time around. I am convinced that 50% of the time I play with someone new, they usually dominate, get super confident, then lose the next round usually by an astronomical margin. It's a good game night game since it lasts about 30 minutes to an hour depending on how many players are engaged in it. Hopefully you get this and it satisfies your hobby of playing cards for good fellowship with friends and family!",positive,positive
Hasbro Game of Life Junior,"Fun game. My 5 and 7 year old's love it. They wanted to play the adult version often, but with the larger money amounts and all the different cards for jobs and houses and such, it just turned out to be a hassle. This game makes it super easy for young players to go around the board and earn money and stars. Not a lot of parts, just easy $1 dollar bills, and a couple of game cards per player.",positive,positive

"SKYJO by Magilano - The entertaining card game for kids and adults. The ideal game for fun, entertaining and exciting hours of play with friends and family.","Once you wrap your head around how to play (YouTube if necessary) it's a very simple yet addicting game easily played with kids of many ages (or just the grown ups) all at the same time, play as competitively or uncompetitive as you want.  If you need a shorter game play to 50, or a single hand, longer game 200, or whoever goes out needs to be ahead by 10, house rules of maximum cards flipped per turn ect... There's no end to the ways you can modify to keep it exciting once you have basic gameplay, and the kids are doing all that adding and subtracting every turn trying to see what everyone has for points showing and they don't even think twice about it ;-)",positive,positive
Hasbro Gaming Bop It! Electronic Game for Kids Ages 8 & Up,"I opened this product not knowing what to expect and manipulated one of the three user interface switches. To my surprise, a voice sounded. ""Bop it,"" it said, as if it was well-used to being obeyed. Cowed, I complied. I thought I was done. The device had different ideas. ""Twist it,"" it demanded. It took me a moment, but there's a sort of spinning toggle one can ""twist""; I eagerly did so. At this time I thought ""Now, I am certainly done; what a wild ride this was. Man alive, my heart is literally pounding."" ""Pull it,"" The device demanded. I do not know if in making this third ask the device intended on the results it produced in me. I was at first filled with a sense of betrayal; not of the device itself, but from the world generally. But those feelings faded as I realized the unbelievable scope of possibilities open before me; the device might ask for anything, at any time! Anything! I felt awareness of my own free will wash over me as euphoria washes over a man who realizes he is free to both mount and not mount a horse. Yet that free will was tempered by awareness the sage hand of the device; as a child dancing on a cliff, I felt the comforting tether of restraint provided by this mystic conglomerate of metal, plastic and stored potential chemical energy. Free, yet safe. Wild, yet shepherded. I will never be the same, nor would I wish to be.",positive,positive

I expected it to be at least a $70 toy but glad to find it less than half that. I did find out pretty quickly that it wouldn’t stay in an upright position. This wouldn’t be a problem but my son has a few little quirks and it frustrated him to no end that it wouldn’t stand. I contacted Amazon and was sent a replacement. Same thing with that as well. We had no issue with the handle clicking into place, just the fact that they both just fall back. I don’t know how to make it work so they’re both returned. I ended up ordering the stick version so at least my son wouldn’t have that to worry about!",neutral,neutral

These pens have turned out to be wonderful other than the fact it shows them you can read stuff and not read it which mostly everything I write is unreadable but they use it at work and have taken it home to their kids. This is a fantastic product and plan on buying more. I’ve already bought two dozen and I have to go to a Fourth of July party with some younger children and I’m sure this will be a big hit as well as an expensive well worth the price and so far I’ve worked excellent,positive,positive

Czech Games Codenames: Duet - The Two Player Word Deduction Game,"My husband and I love original Codenames, but we are usually playing games at home with just the two of us. Codenames Duet is a great two-player game option that keeps many of the original Codenames elements in place. We were surprised at how challenging this game is! It's tough to be constantly both thinking of clues and guessing the other person's clues. The fact that the assassin clues are different for both people keeps me on my toes- a code that is an assassin for me might be a clue my partner is trying to get me to guess. I highly recommend this for people looking for a great two-player game option.",positive,positive

You can build a house with a flower and that’s cute and all but she doesn’t wanna build a race car or lighthouse. She likes having more colors to use but honestly for the price I feel there should be more options on what to build.,negative,negative

They are tiny enough to fit in pretty much any bag. There is only so much you can do with this little bit of PlayDoh, but they are fine for tiny hands.

As noted by other reviewers, these are not “reusable stickers” they are “removable” as in they won’t separate or tear as easily as standard paper based stickers. But since this also includes a new map board, you won’t likely need to peel them off. This is all you really need to refresh your game if you ever wanted to re-sell or gift your game to a friend when you’re done with it. If it came with some new character sheets, that would be even better, but as it is, it’s great!",positive,positive

The problem I have had is that after about week, using about an hour a day, there are spots where the top layer is showing wear and the colors beneath are showing through. She has only used it while I am sitting with her, so this is from normal use. I like this product, I just wish the quality was better.",positive,positive
Melissa & Doug Stainless Steel Pots and Pans Pretend Play Kitchen Set for Kids (8 pcs),"I got this set for my 18mo old granddaughter. When I first got it I, all I could do was adore how darling it was and go through each item and think of things I could make with my granddaughter. She came to visit a few days later and loved it. I poured some Kix in one pot and some yogurt in another and she had a blast stirring those around and test tasting them. I need to get a little oven for her but meanwhile she used a box that was the perfect height for her to cook her meal. Some adult women friends were over and I just had to show them and they too thought it was just adorable and wanted to try to cook with them. It's astonishing how alike they are to the adult versions. I'm super pleased with this set. The little rack is super convenient for storing them all together. I keep them on a shelf of my lazy Susan so she can get to them easily when we're in the kitchen together. I'm sure this set will bring many years of joy and delicious little make-believe treats for us to enjoy and share.",positive,positive

Gone is the horrible stink, the nasty texture, the staining colors. Smooth, pleasant smell (almost no smell at all), and only the black left a color behind on the play surface that was easily wiped up with wet wipes. 2 ounce packages are the perfect size for toddlers and one container keeps little hands busy. The packages seal back up well (also better than original play doh) but don't leave the doh sitting out because it does dry out if not being kneaded.  Bigger sets are better value for the money but 3 toddlers are getting plenty of use out of the 10 pack. Combine with Melissa and Doug wooden clay tools for maximum fun.",neutral,positive

The tweezers are fun and I can seee him concentrating when he picks up smaller objects. There are so many possibilities with this set. The plastic does seem a bit thin on some of the tools, but I don't see it breaking unless we have an accident or he gets rough. I also love the colors on them.

The necklace was put back in the little capsule on the back if the box but it was held in place by...you guessed it, packing tape. As much as I love the toy, I am returning it.

If you have little ones that have trouble with the regular size and shape of Crayolas (small and roll away) these are a must.,positive,positive

LEGO Creator 3in1 Sports Car Toy 31100 Building Kit (134 Pieces),"My 5 year old really likes building Lego toys. He recently received a Ninjango Jungle Raider car as a gift. I was happily surprised at how well it ran so I purchased this 3 in 1 Sports Car Toy and I'm not disappointed. Lego cars stay together much better than other Lego toys, such as Avenger Mechs for example. So I'd rather him build these cars that we can play with, without having to pick up little Lego pieces all the time. He also build the plane on his own and after building the car with the white stripes, he wants to move on to the other sports car. So you really get a bang for your buck with this toy, for kids who enjoy putting them together.",positive,positive

We've bought many Melissa and Doug products over the years, and this is the first time anything like this has happened;  I assume our stamp pad was just sitting in a warehouse somewhere for too long.  It's my own fault that I waited more than 30 days to try it out, so I could not return it to Amazon.

Melissa & Doug Magnetic Human Body Anatomy Play Set With 24 Magnetic Pieces and Storage Tray,"I ordered a wooden puzzle of layered anatomy from another manufacturer.  Its quality wasn't all I hoped to have, so I specifically searched Amazon for the same general concept from trusted Melissa & Doug.  I am a big fan.  I thought they would get it right.  Melissa &Doug's design of layered magnets is even more wonderful than I hoped.  I love it.  The stout wooden box has perfect dividers for optimal storage of the 24 pieces.  But, NO LID!  Dang, Melissa & Doug!  What a let-down.  I have little hope of keeping this set together without a top for its box, and it won't be much fun or very educational without all of its pieces.  I can trash the wooden box to use another container for future storage, but what a waste!  I would gladly pay more for the same set if the good wooden box just had a lid.  It's what I would expect from Melissa & Doug products.",negative,neutral
Casdon Dyson Cord-Free Vacuum | Interactive Toy Dyson Vacuum For Children Aged 3+ | Includes Working Suction For Realistic Play,"Love that my daughter vacuums with me while I use my dyson and she uses this.  The only thing that has broke since she got it from Santa is the plastic cover for the canister. It’s the same plastic cover that’s on the real Dyson so with any drops of it, of course it’s going to break, it’s plastic. No fault of the toy, just children not being careful & breaking toys unintentionally.  It still works so it’s not an issue.",positive,positive

"Bicycle Standard Face Playing Cards, 2 Piece","So disappointed! I grew up playing w/Bicycle brand cards for years! Always loved the quality, weight, texture and material. Our home was destroyed by toxic mold and I missed my cards so my husband splurged and specifically ordered this brand. Material is thin & feels like some type of plastic or something with a weird material with a tiny cross hatched pattern to them, I'm assuming in an attempt to make them slippery but it doesn't help. They are way more slippery than old decks, even brand new, used to be. Hard to even shuffle them. So, unfortunately, like many other companies, Bicycle has followed suit (pun intended) and opted for cheaper materials. Makes me sad, especially when much of the reason people play with""real"" cards is for the feel & texture of them in their hands. I get it, cheaper materials=making more money. Just unfortunate, especially with some where ""the feel"" matters so much. I'm disappointed Bicycle!",negative,negative

Hasbro Gaming Trouble Board Game for Kids Ages 5 and Up 2-4 Players,"I would give this zero stars if I could. The quality of this item is very poor. It is flimsy and poorly constructed. It has new rules that I do not remember from the original game. I was so excited to get this game because I loved it so much as a kid, but my 8 year old hated it!  If you just want the game and do not care about how cheap the box is (it ripped when we tried to open the tape), or how cheap the flimsy piece of paper that you have to attach to the cheap plastic base is, then I guess you will be okay.  I wish I could return it, but we ripped the box so I am not sure if they will take it back.",negative,negative

The reason for the 2% is if you’re looking for the marking, and shine it towards a light, you can see it (but barely). & people won’t pay any attention to the back of the card. Then you shine the UV light attached and can see it clearly! Awesome pen.",positive,positive

Finding this game on Amazon was a nostalgic find for me because our family used to play this on Friday nights when I was younger and I wanted to continue that tradition with my own children. The cards look a little different than the original cards but they are still great, brightly colored and the game is fun. My children ask to play over and over and it is often a favorite on our game nights. I strongly recommend this game for families off all ages. Our 7 year old is able to play with just a little bit of assistance right alongside my 85 year old grandparents. A game that withstands generations!",positive,positive

"Crayola Twistables Colored Pencil Set, School Supplies, Coloring Gift,50 Count","I love to color and do it often to relax. The Twistables are my favorite because it is in the middle between a crayon and a colored pencil. I ordered some that came in a carrying case that I liked a lot better. The packaging makes it hard with these because there are so many that they just fall out or to the side too easily. There were also several that would not stay turned when I used them, meaning that you have to twist them to get the colored part out and when I would put it to the paper it would go right back in and not hold. Other than that it's fine.",positive,neutral

I love that she combines the many shapes and colors from this box to add to her creations or modify the ones in the Lego instructions. The box is large enough to contain many, many more Legos than come with it, so it's now the main container for her Lego collection. We've bought this as a gift for my daughter's friends. If they already own legos, this proves to be a great addition and a great place to store the others. If it's their first set, the instructions provided give a great introduction to Lego creativity.",positive,positive

"LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Mario Starter Course 71360 Building Kit, Interactive Set Featuring Mario, Bowser Jr. and Goomba Figures (231 Pieces)","If you’re looking for something to reduce screen time for your child, this is not it. There’s not an instruction book with any of the sets. You have to download an app, that works spotty at best, and build from that. I really think lego did parents and kids a great disservice with these sets. The app very rarely works, even after deleting and reinstalling several times. Finally just looked up videos on YouTube, which was a whole new level of frustration pausing and playing the video. I do not recommend these sets at all.",negative,negative
"Disney Pixar Toy Story 4 Woody and Bullseye 2-Character Pack, Movie-inspired Relative-Scale for Storytelling Play [Amazon Exclusive]","I liked everything about this set. My son likes to play with Bullseye and Woody. My only complaint is that I thought Woody talked when you pulled the string on his back (he does not make any sound), the loop is molded plastic, and molded with the rest of the body. So Woody does not say ""reach for the sky"" as expected. Maybe I should have read closer. I dont know if my son knows the difference though.",positive,positive

Relationship Deck by BestSelf ― 150 Discussion Prompts for Real Relationship Conversations ― Relationship Cards for Deeper Connection and Better Love,"I loved these! Several categories of questions and we could pick or choose which to do based on the sensitivity of questions and feelings that day. This was bought in an effort to learn more about each other in a time we were considering divorce. Unfortunately my husband thought they were ‘stupid’ and ‘unrealistic’, as were my efforts (his words and his counselor agreed) so he threw them away. I think couples in a good place in their relationship would meet with better outcomes than I did. Many questions are thought provoking and interesting like what we plan for retirement, something we would change about each other and things about our childhood. In the few days we had them and used them I found out things about him that he hadn’t ever talked about in our 20 years together.",positive,positive

"Crayola Ultra Clean Washable Markers, Broad Line Markers, Gifts, 40 Classic Colors","These are good quality markers.  Note that they are SMALL!  Pip Squeaks, as in little.  Each marker is only about 4 inches long with the cap on.  So about 1/2 the size of the regular skinny Crayola markers.  Obviously they have less ink than a standard carrel marker.  But, we bought these to take on vacation, so the smaller size was perfect for travel.  There are 64 markers in the box, and it says that there are 64 distinct colors.  I have to say that several of them look identical on paper, even though the cap colors are different.  Overall, a good marker for a good price, and I am happy with the purchase.  I would buy again.",positive,positive
Play-Doh Sweet Shoppe Cookie Creations,This was a last-minute gift for Christmas but has quickly become my daughter's favorite toy which I did not expect.

"12 Pack of 7 Dinosaur Toy Figures with Educational Dinosaur Book, Large Plastic Dinosaur Toys Set for Toddlers, Kids, Boys and Girls","Someone had asked a question about whether these are hollow or solid, and the question was answered saying they were solid, so I purchased them solely for outdoor play in my daycare, as I need them to withstand being crashed around and left out in the elements. I did not read the followup responses from buyers, so that's my fault, but I was very frustrated to open the package and find they are, in fact, hollow. Shipping took longer than expected, and the misrepresentation of the item has me rather disappointed, as they are not solid and are, in fact, slightly bendable and squishy, too, so I fear they may collect water inside.",negative,negative

It did have a hard time with the transition between the different flooring. But overall a great remote control toy. It has a lot of different modes that keep you engaged. My 7 and 8 year old loved it. The price point was a win for me also. Fun, easy to use toy.",positive,positive

"Crayola Ultra Clean Washable Markers, Broad Line Markers, Gifts, 40 Classic Colors","I love these markers!!! I have used these markers for several years now to color with and you can't go wrong with them. They don't bleed threw the lines and the colors are true to the color on the caps. You get a good assortment of colors with this set of markers and they are easy to grip just as much as a regular size markers. I love the tips of these markers as well you can make thin and thick lines with them which is pretty handy. For the amount of coloring I do (which is a lot) they last a long time. These markers are great for almost every type of project you have coloring books, posters, stamping, etc.",positive,positive

Yes they are small, like penny size or smaller, but that wasn't an issue for us. Upon opening the package there was a strong odor that came from the stickers. I let them air out before she used them, but even still that smell is still there so maybe it has to do with the adhesive. That is the only reason I gave this a 4 star, other than that the product works great for what we need.",positive,positive

It is a new twist on playing cards- the goal is to get them in a sequence on the board.  It is easy to l earn and really fun.  I recommend this game- BUT do not buy the ""Letters Sequence"" game for kids the cards and the board do not match, it is letters and pictures, everyone has to use the legend of what goes where, gets old having to look it up and pass the paper around.",neutral,positive

How exciting to look through the stack of 50 and feel the thrill of seeing the same card over and over. Good thing that feeling doesn't diminish or get old, because it happens a lot with this set. I should have ordered two packs so we could extend the excitement! I may keep ordering hoping I can get as lucky as a previous reviewer who had the good fortune of getting two different cards in this set of 50. To think, being blessed with 25 copies of the same 2 cards. Oh The Joy!",positive,negative

"Play-Doh Modeling Compound 24-Pack Case of Colors, Non-Toxic, Multi-Color, 3-Ounce Cans, Ages 2 and up (Amazon Exclusive)","My kids love play-doh and can spend hours playing it so why not get them the rainbow. I received various colors but also repeated colors. Now I can be negative about the repeated colors but theres also pros to it. Main one being no fighting for the color, my 2 children can get the same color for short activities or when going to grandmas. I also did open them to check for mold and everything looked good. On another note the caps are TIGHTLY sealed! Im an adult and I had a little hard time opening some but again can also be a pro, my 2 year old can not easily open these and the playdoh doesn't dry. My main reason for the 4 stars is I'm slightly disappointed that I didn't receive a solid blue or red and it should be sold as advertised. Regardless its a good buy, the play doh will be played with.",positive,positive

I’ve noticed my 2 year old daughter has shown new interest in baby dolls. I had a full sized one as a kid in the 80s. I got this newborn as a tester to see what she thought. I handed it to her out of the box and she responded “Hi, baby.” Then kisses the doll. A drop of sap melted off my cold, cynical heart. I forgot they come with a “birth certificate” and are scented.

"Magna-Tiles 32-Piece Clear Colors Set, The Original Magnetic Building Tiles For Creative Open-Ended Play, Educational Toys For Children Ages 3 Years +","I got these for my 2-year-old. The price is shocking but I used some gift cards which made it more reasonable. The first few days my child got VERY frustrated with them, (there is a bit of a learning curve in how much weight certain sizes can bear and how high they stack—STEM learning I guess!) but now they are played with quietly every. single. day. For the original price, they did seem somewhat cheaply made out of the box. I think they are worth it when discounted or purchased with gift cards. FYI—keep them away from essential oils. They will melt them together permanently. (I’m guessing the manufacturer didn’t intend this use case but I have a little scientist who gets into everything so now you know.)",positive,positive
"Tara Toys Disney Princess Necklace Activity Set, 9.7x8.18x2","Great for ""mommy and daughter time"" as my girls said. We took out the package and all 5 of us made a necklace. Love that it comes with elastic cords. You don't need anything else. Not even scissors. We did however do a knot on each side after the neckalces were made, to prevent the beads from falling off taking the necklace on and off. Then danced the night away with the princess party CD. Yes it's for birthday parties, but we had fun anyways. Highly recommend this product.",positive,positive

Czech Games Codenames: Duet - The Two Player Word Deduction Game,"Fantastic 2P cooperative implementation of the original Codenames. Great game for couples. The included ""campaign"" map is rather bare-bones, but it honestly adds a lot to the game's replay value, giving you increasingly more challenging games to work through. I'd be worried about gifting this to a non-gamer without also sending them a link to a tutorial video online, but the same could be said for a lot of modern tabletop games. On the other hand, this is a wonderful gift for anyone who's already played the original Codenames. My partner and I play with the cards from the original game mixed in, as well as the Codenames Pictures cards. The mix of pictures and words is super fun.",positive,positive
"Retevis RT628 Walkie Talkies for Kids,Toys for 5-13 Year Old Boys Girls,Key Lock,Crystal Voice, Easy to Use,Long Range Walky Talky for Camping Hiking(Red,2 Pack)","Decent range, I tested it by slowly driving away from the house and talking to my wife. I got about 3/4 of a mile before I completely lost reception, 1/2 mile is where I lost the ability to carry out a conversation. This was done in a residential area, no houses over 2 story, mostly single story, and on flat ground. Setting this up is somewhat easy if you have the manual. I kept getting the volume and channels mixed up. Overall it's good for talking to people who are close by and not doing anything in metal buildings or near high electricity uses.",neutral,positive
Bicycle Dice 10 Pack,"I do not understand how it is so difficult to make uniform dice.  Despite some of the bad reviews I bought these, because we wanted some good quality dice.

Melissa & Doug Reusable Sticker Pad: Habitats - 150+ Reusable Stickers 7 Ounces,"My grandson loves these! He’s 21 months old and loves construction vehicles so these were a big hit. Clearly at his age he doesn’t use them properly on the scenes in the book. There is a nice construction scene, airport scene and water scene. Instead he sticks them on windows and glass surfaces all over the house. Kids love to stick their stickers everywhere they are not supposed to.  But these stick and release all over, don’t leave any smudges, and have held up well, still sticky.",positive,positive
Cards Against Humanity,"This game is THE most uncomfortable game I've ever played! I kept hearing from a ton of people that I needed to get this game and play it ASAP! I searched all around the stores before I realized I couldn't buy it anywhere but Amazon (at the time). After I ordered it, I had it shipped to my parent's house because we were all going to be there for a family reunion. BIG MISTAKE No one told me this game was extremely raunchy and possibly inappropriate depending on age of players and such. From the very beginning of playing and trying to choose who would start the game to the questions that followed, we had several family members drop out after the first couple of questions because the questions were disgusting, disturbing, offensive, and uncomfortable to answer. I was not interested in playing every again. FAST FORWARD I decided to play this game with a small group of very close friends and we had a BLAST! We know each other very well, and the group of 10 or so of us made it fun because we knew we wouldn't judge each other for our frivolous answers and such. This would be the ONLY way I'd ever play this game in the future!",negative,positive

Regardless I think my nephew will love them.",neutral,neutral
Hanes Men's Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt Value Pack (4-pack),"I went up a size, due to the many reviews suggesting this.  But the Charcoal Heather shirts are made of a cotton-poly blend, so they are true-to-size.  The shirts were huge when I got them, and after many washings they are still pretty big.  But they are holding up well. The info printed on the shirt is black-on-gray, so I can't determine if the cotton-poly blend is 90/10, 50/50, etc.  The shirts are comfy, just a bit scratchy. If I ordered them again, I would get then in 100% cotton (so it would be some other color), in which case going up a size would probably still be a good idea.",positive,positive

"Mexican Train Dominoes Game in Aluminum Carry Case, for Adults, Families and Kids Ages 8 and up","fun and addicting game.  Giving this 4 stars because one of the dominoes in the set has a gigantic chunk missing from it and I didn't receive the hub.  After playing the game with my sister-in-law, she bought one of her own.  She bought the same brand from a local big box store rather than online and hers was missing the scorecard.  I guess if you get everything it's supposed to contain you are one of the lucky ones!

"Learning Resources Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register - 73 Pieces, Ages 3+ Develops Early Math Skills, Play Cash Register for Kids, Toy Cash Register, Play Money for Kids","My 4.5 year old was so excited to get this on Christmas! Then we opened it. This WILL NOT work unless it is in bright, direct light. The solar panels are a joke. So my kiddo cannot play with the toy in her room as it isn't bright enough, even with the light on and curtains open. So no play at night or in her room. It literally only works in the living room on a sunny day with the curtains open. Then when the drawer opens it comes out with such fury that the coins go flying in every direction, every time. There are 3 openings for paper money and 4 different denominations. (1s, 5s, 10s & 20s) It's a cute idea but not being able to use it when wanted due to the lacking solar panels is a bummer. I'd recommend saving your money and getting a battery powered register with less issues so your kid can play with it whenever they want and coins don't fly every time the drawer is opened.",negative,negative

Melissa & Doug 20 Wooden Animal Magnets in a Box,"Great magnet set for my little one. Purchased when he started playing with all the magnets on the fridge at 12 months old but i wanted safer magnets so bought these. We have them low on the fridge and i place him daily on the floor to play with these. The designs are not going to win any creativity or artistic awards but they are interesting to my son, easy to remove off the fridge and back on again, and i don't see any peeling of the stickers as yet (and he puts them in his mouth all the time). Overall a successful product. Would like to see some greater effort put into the images. Also- i wish melissa and doug would provide a wooden cover top for their awesome boxes so i could store these when not in use. Seems silly to just have a  box without a top.",positive,positive

My granddaughter has spent hours playing with it since Christmas.,positive,positive
Play Nine - The Card Game of Golf!,"This is a great game! I highly recommend it. It's even more fun if you have additional players, but if like us you don't immediately have extra players, it really works for 2 people to be an additional player. We used colored and numbered sticky notes so we could go in order without being able to aid our second ghost player and it made it a bit more complex and fun!!",positive,positive

"Wingspan Board Game - A Bird-Collection, Engine-Building Stonemaier Game for 1-5 Players, Ages 14+","While it is a euro-style, engine-building, tally-points-from-stuff game, the concept itself is smart, the artwork gorgeous, and the layout intuitive to help you follow the rules. It has been our go-to for several weeks now as there are plenty of bird cards, which have different functions, and a good mix of random luck (card draws and dice rolls) and strategy (focusing on one or another group and the bonus cards to leap ahead). It also seems to have been thoughtfully made for modifications and different rules, like the option to make end-of-round goals competitive (only one gets the most points, others get less) or cooperative (everyone who can complete the goal gets points). It also is a faster game, taking about an hour to an hour and a half, much faster than something like Agricola or Terraforming Mars. It's also more focused on working your own board rather than ruining others' progress, and many cards give bonuses for others along with a bigger one for yourself. But the crazy thing is how much I love the packaging! Everything goes into its own little provided container and fits perfectly back into the box! The aftermarket board game organizers must rue the neatness of the built-in solution. And of course, the bird theme is everywhere, down to the birdhouse dice roller. Just really smart. Anyway, it's an easy to learn into to euro-style games that still has depth, the ability for expansion, and clear rules.",positive,positive

"Learning Resources Farmer's Market Color Sorting Set - 30 Pieces, Ages 18+ months Pretend Play Toys for Toddlers, Play Food for Toddlers, Play Kitchen for Toddlers","I got this set for my LO 1st birthday because I love food and I love how accurate these looked.  They really are some of the best shaped food I've seen.  I really didn't know if my baby would be into this set yet, but she loves it!  She pulls out the baskets and sorts the veggies into different ones.  She carries them around and dumps them and then puts them back in.  I know she will still enjoy this set when she gets more into imaginative play. The produce has a good soft hand but also feels extremely durable.  The only downside was that it smelled bad when it first came out of the box, but that has passed.  I'll look for more toys from this company. Update:  We've had these for four years and they still look brand new.  We still play with them several times a week.  I'm in awe of their durability.  We don't sort them into colors much, but the buckets are used for play all of the time as well.  You can't go wrong with this set.  It really is amazing.",positive,positive

"Kids Against Maturity: Card Game for Kids and Families, Super Fun Hilarious for Family Party Game Night","If Tom Green met Tom Green and had an in-bred child together and that inbred Tom Green befriended and got high with that stupid Asian dude who won the second season  of last comic standing.... and they made a game together.... I rarely write reviews . And I have never written a negative one until now. I know it's called ""kids against maturity"", but you're either going to be too old for it or too young for it. There is no just right age for this and I felt like an irresponsible and immature parent letting my kids joke with poops, farts, dingle berries and butts for even 5 rounds. ...and if this sounds attractive to a teenage mind who has an allergic reaction to intelligence or sobriety, I want to state that even stoned teenagers won't be entertained, as there is no clever composition in 28 of 30 cards.",negative,negative

"Pokémon Assorted Cards, 50 Pieces","I bought this as a starter set for my 5year old son. Everything I know about pokemon cards, I know from him. This deck came with all 50 cards. They all look authentic. They are from years 2003-2015. I'd say only 1/4 is pokemon and the rest are item cards. There was 1 duplicate and 1 card in Japanese(?). He's happy so I'm happy. From reading other reviews it seems like we got lucky! We purchased from Mr. Magic and had good results. Thanks!",positive,positive

LEGO Classic Medium Creative Brick Box 10696 Building Toys for Creative Play; Kids Creative Kit (484 Pieces),"I am not sure i would purchase again. Purchased thinking there would be several lego blocks in the box being there were 484 pieces, however, many of these pieces are tiny pieces that would take 20 pieces to equate to the size of a regular lego block. I should have read the box more to confirm what I was purchasing, as the pictures make it look like you are getting more than what is pictured. Will need to go look for another tub of regular size blocks. This box has many, many irregular, or unusual pieces. Not much fun for the grandchildren to build many building type pieces.",negative,neutral

"Crayola Colored Pencils, Adult Coloring, Fun At Home Activities, 50 Count, Multicolor","I see a lot of reviews ding this set for not being ""Profession Grade"", but given the price point I don't think its meant to live up to that lofty goal.  This is aimed squarely at the adult amateur that wants to dip a toe into the art world.  I'm 50 years old and was in need of a simple cheap hobby.  Buying this pencil set and an adult color book fits that perfectly.  Its affordable and good quality for someone just starting out. So after all of that why did I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars.  The only real problem I have with this set is the holder for the pencils is cheap cardboard that makes it all but impossible to keep the pencils in their proper place.  If they had spent the extra money to have individual holsters for the pencils (preferably cloth not cardboard)  then this would be a solid 5 stars. If you are thinking of getting into coloring but don't want to spend a lot of money then this set will give you hours of enjoyment.",positive,positive

Hasbro Gaming Guess Who? Game Original Guessing Game for Kids Ages 6 and Up for 2 Players,Great game but like most things these days; cheap and very politically correct. I wish I would’ve gone with the older version. The rectangle pieces fall out very easily as do the thin cardboard pictures. 3 stars only because it’s still fun to play with my kids,neutral,neutral
"Bandai America - Original Tamagotchi, Candy Swirl",I love tamagotchis. I have a Tama P and a Tama Friends. I also still have an old tamagotchi from the 90s that still works. I adore having this one.  I give it 5 stars and go Bandai! Thanks for bringing these back!! I've seen some confusion with the date on the back. They were rel-released in Japan in 2017.  It takes a bit for them to be translated into English and released here which is why they say 2017 on the back vs. 2018.,positive,positive

SET Enterprises Five Crowns Card Game Purple,"This is an excellent game to play w all ages.  Everybody I introduce to this game goes out and buys it.

What Do You Meme? Core Game - The Hilarious Adult Party Game for Meme Lovers,Always been a fan of the Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity and this game is right in line with that style.  The pros are the meme's add a visual level to the game which helps narrow your answers.  (The other games let the judge's imagination run wild)  I'd suggest playing this with a group of over 4 though to really help add comedic answers as too few of people options are just less.  It's nice because the game has mature content cards which can be added or removed depending on who's playing but overall it will have some level of vulgarity to it for those family friendly people. Overall I would say we enjoy the game it's a good mix if you've played the other variants and if you haven't played Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity it's a good game to pickup.,positive,positive

Only issue I had, was that I had my son read the rules... He left out about 1/2 of the rules... and I was like, so why do they call it the robber?  Why does it matter where you move it? (He left out the part about it keeping production at 0 while it was there)... After the first game,  we dug back into the rules and discovered that a city gave 2x the production that a settlement does, and that you can't directly build a city... little things he left out... but we didn't go through the entire rules at that time, I did that after we were done... The additional rules (i.e. the rules) would have made the game longer, but more balanced and fair, and given me a better chance of winning... All in all outstanding!",positive,positive

"LEGO Chain Reactions (Klutz Science/STEM Activity Kit), 9"" Length x 1.06"" Width x 10"" Height","Bought this for a trip present and the concept is very cool. I hope it will encourage my nephew to do more with his blocks than just assemble the ""kits."" A few downsides I noticed though. It was almost impossible to get the legos out without tearing the flap thus making it useless to hold the bits ever again. I had to apply patience, a gentle touch and go get a tool to help me open the flap in such a way that it could be reused. Perhaps for at-home use no big deal but as a travel toy it is a poor design. Also, I didn't realize that ONLY ONE of these exercises can be done with the kit alone! Fair, I guess, but when I went to gather a few more legos so that my nephew could assemble more than one of the machines it was very frustrating to figure out what would be needed. Again, ONLY ONE additional exercise specifically laid out the extra LEGOS needed. The rest all said ""as needed,"" but it wasn't really ""as needed,"" there were very specific sizes that needed to be used. Yes, some of the bricks show in the diagrams COULD be substituted with slightly different brick configuration, but there were still A LOT OF SPECIFIC bits needed. I had to spend hours basically building everything myself to collect appropriate parts in order to have this work out fro me as planned. :(  Sad for me or those who plan to take on the road. If you plan to use at home with access to all your other LEGOS no big deal for you probably.",negative,neutral

Just be aware that this is the Retro version of the game, the original version. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing if that is what you were looking for. Unfortunately that is not the version we were looking for. The front photo of the cover of the box, is the newer version. Which is what you think you are getting, but the inside photos are the older version. Very misleading and led to a quick return from me. Be clear in your description.

PicassoTiles 2 Piece Car Truck Construction Kit Toy Set Vehicle Educational Magnet Building Tile Magnetic Blocks Puzzle Magnets Toys with Re-Enforced Hitch and Long Bed for Girls Boys Toddler Ages 3+,"Love these! Had them for awhile now, and they fit seamlessly with both the Picasso Tiles and the Magna Tiles. Adds a fun new play to the magnet tiles. They link together easy for any age, but do come apart if using in a bumpy area - but that hasn't caused them any frustration. They love to build 'houses' and things on top of them - and even put small stuffed animals and things inside - like making a zoo train.  We've bought 2 sets now - as one set doesn't really make a train. I do however like that there are only 2 in a set as this makes it affordable for a gift giving option... we love to do 'add-on' sets for gifts - so someone can afford to buy the kids something to add onto existing sets without spending too much and also not instead buying junk toys that would go in the trash after they break. This concept also keeps from being overwhelmed with too many different types of toys.",positive,positive

I have inherited many pots & pans and there are 'nooks and crannies' in the handles and curled areas of these items that are difficult to clean with 'normal' dishcloths and scrubbers and brushes.  I also have a toilet with one under-rim hole that refuses to be easy to clean.

Melissa & Doug Stainless Steel Pots and Pans Pretend Play Kitchen Set for Kids (8 pcs),Bought this for my 3yr old daughter and she enjoys anything cooking so it worked at first. Only thing is we dont have a play kitchen for her to use it in and see how it all comes together in a cooking setting so she plays a little on the table and moves on to the next toy.  These are stainless steel and look like good quality when you receive. You cannot actually cook on them (or I wouldn't recommend) but it's adorable that they have miniature size cookware like we use! Be prepared if your little one likes to bang them together.. so i wouldn't recommend for under 3 years of age.,positive,positive
Hasbro Game of Life Junior,"So your kids have graduated from the iconic board game known as Candy Land.  Is it time for them to grow up? Maybe take on some responsibilities?  Manage their money, and use their skills in the Junior world?  Are they ready for Game of Life - Junior?! If your child is 8 and up - like my nephew, he would probably be better off playing Roblox or Minecraft or the adult version of Game of Life (which he won). If your child is under 8, the game may be better if you start off playing along with them instead of against them. Some Gold Stars: >>As far as board illustration it is completely beautiful.  Like Candy Land you want a board that ignites the imagination and I think the board-art in the Game of Life Junior does that well. >>It doesn’t have to be exactly like the original Game of LIfe.  As a Junior your life should be care-free; eating ice cream at the beach, visiting the zoo after having stuffing your face at the chocolate factory.  Imagination is key here, and I understand why they have those action cards. >>The introduction of money.  There’s no compound interest or mortgage but just the introduction of money is enough. The game is open for home renditions and rules. Instead of stars use animal crackers. Or try introducing fun-size packaged candy or fruit roll-ups as a side vendor to redeem that money. Some Black Stars: >>The spinner feels cheap, doesn’t feel random and has no suspense.  It is supposed to spin like a top but there’s too much friction.  One can control the spin depending on your pressure.  I say trade it in for a Pop-O-Matic (Trouble), or improve the spin, or use a die. I get it the adult life has the same spinner, I say trade that one in as well. >>“My Book of Adventures” is really just a single card where you place your stars that always seem to fall off. I would suggest that the deluxe version use magnetic backing. >>Some action (charade) cards are too difficult for young children and may prove to be frustrating: Winning a Race Think of a Song and hum it Think of a Cartoon character and act like it Scoring a goal Playing catch Making a cake Sack race Crossing the road A Circus Clown Spoon and Egg Race >>Certain action cards give two stars. It’s unclear if the player doing the action gets the stars or the player who guessed correctly or both.",neutral,neutral

Hasbro Gaming Trouble Board Game for Kids Ages 5 and Up 2-4 Players,"Classic game that I loved as a kid! It’s easy for any age! For littler kids, it’s hard for them to tell the difference between the track and the home spaces because they’re squished so close together. Also, the cardboard insert that marks the spaces makes the board a bit bouncy for the pieces so it’s easy for them to fall off if there’s an over-excited player. But otherwise it’s a great game!",positive,positive
"Monopoly Junior Board Game, Ages 5 and up (Amazon Exclusive)","My daughter loves this game.  It is easy to teach and to learn.  A bit different from the adult game but the dynamics and rules of the game are laid out the same.  Children get to buy and rent their own properties.  There is a bank, Chance cards, free parking, go to jail, and collecting money for passing Go.  Very good way to kill time on boring and cold days.  Helps with counting, adding, subtracting, and taking turns.  I would like to see more sturdy pieces to place on the properties after buying them.  The small cardboard cutouts easily slide off the board.  It works for my little girl though.  Would recommend!",positive,positive

We looked at the rest of dresses and the material used was tethered where sewn so this would continue to be a problem. My 4yr old had the same set and upon comparing them, there were some better made than others within both packs. One of the necklaces broke as well while trying to gently put it on for the first time. The shoes were hit or miss as well. I would not purchase this again or recommend to anyone (not even for the cheap price) unless you aren’t planning on getting more than two or three dress changes with them. It’s a shame, because the designs are very nice.",negative,negative
Melissa & Doug Cutting Fruit Set - Wooden Play Food Kitchen Accessory,"I got this as a gift for the child I nanny. He’s 18mo and enjoys it. The knife is the perfect size to get learning about using kitchen utensils. He’s learning about identifying different fruits and we’re starting to learn super super basic math (halves, thirds, etc). He gets creative putting one half of the fruit with another half. When I gave this to him he played for 45 solid minutes with it! Unfortunately, the Velcro is sunken a little far into the fruit on a few pieces so they have a hard time sticking together. A bummer, but doesn’t affect how much he likes it.",positive,positive

The mat works well! The volume range seems to go from loud to LOUDER. There's no soft volume option despite having the control that supposedly offers that.

It's sort of addicting actually!  After our first experience with the game, i have ordered it four other times as gifts!  The game is simple enough for elementary aged children, yet interesting enough for adults.  Our group of friends (all in our 50's) enjoyed playing.  Cards are colorful. Had to read through the rules a few times - but once they are understood they are easy to explain.  I am very pleased that I came across this game.  Also - you can play this game with up to 8 people - so that is also a plus.",positive,positive

It has a really nice magnetic box, so nothing will fall out easily. Despite this being a game of chance and numbers, you don't have to be good at math to enjoy it!

Train pieces are pretty cheap plastic which I didn't love, but the dominoes are really nice and sturdy - 5 stars for those for sure. Bummer - the game was missing the black hub.  I ended up cutting out a little hub from a piece of cardboard as my niece seemed to really need/want that part of the game to play and understand the 'tracks.'  Haven't had much luck trying to contact the manufacturer as Amazon sold it.  They want me to return the entire thing.  Seems odd.

I tested the few pens that were leftover and found that the ink was dry on them as well.  Before them putting in the goodie bags,  I had tested the UV light on each pen. Out of the 35 pens, the light on 3 pens didn't work that work that well.  But like buying any pack of pens, I assumed there would be no issue with the ink. Next time, I'll check both the light and ink. I feel embarrassed knowing that we gave out 'dud' pens as gifts that were suppose to unique, cool and fun to my son's whole class.",negative,negative

LEGO Classic Medium Creative Brick Box 10696 Building Toys for Creative Play; Kids Creative Kit (484 Pieces),"I purchased these for my grandson and he loves them.

Very well pleased with the purchase and definitely would purchase again.",positive,positive
Hasbro Gaming: Battleship Classic Board Game Strategy Game Ages 7 and Up For 2 Players,"Was worried about buying this based on other reviews, but went ahead and went for it since my 6 1/2 year old son loves the travel version so much (which is terrible because you can't mark which spots on your ships have been hit).  Honestly, although maybe a touch smaller than the old 1980's version, it's very similar.  We haven't had issues with pegs falling out.  The ships can pop out of place if you knock into the board, but if you keep it on the floor or a table, no worries.  My son is already enjoying having a much better way to play this game!",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Dress-Up Tiaras for Costume Role Play (4 pcs),"I like that these crowns are sturdy enough to withstand being thrown about by a toddler.

I ended up throwing away the silver and gold crowns.",positive,negative
Catan Board Game (Base Game) | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Adventure Board Game | Ages 10+ | for 3 to 4 Players | Average Playtime 60 Minutes | Made by Catan Studio,"We’ve been parents for nearly 30 years, with four kids still at home and married children who visit regularly. My wife is also a highly-esteemed early-educator. We’ve always enjoyed and kept a number of board games, but we’d never tried a “European-style” board game until our son-in-law recommended Catan. It was an instant, smashing success! The kids were pestering us to play constantly. WARNING: I had the Wikipedia page which mentioned the additional drama of European-style board games, but I didn’t get it. It is, indeed nearly impossible to play this game much without someone’s feelings getting hurt. For one thing, people tend to form alliances—but that’s not uncommon in board games. More importantly nearly every action you take tends to harm someone else, and you simply MUST trade with other players frequently to stay in the game. Worst of all, the most common roll of the dice (seven) results in you immediately having to take from another player AND cripple his resources. And if any player gets on a roll for several games, it can start to feel very frustrating—especially for younger players. Drama indeed!",negative,positive
"Crayola Twistables Colored Pencil Set, School Supplies, Coloring Gift,50 Count","These have quickly become my favorite colored pencils! I originally got them for my daughter since she's always taking my pencils for her art projects. Then I sat down to color with them and now these Crayola Twistables Colored Pencils are the only ones I use! Regular pencils tend to hurt my hands after a little while but I don't have that problem with the Twistables. I love that I simply twist the bottom for more lead instead of having to hunt down a pencil sharpener (which we can never find!) plus when I'm finished for the day, I twist to close so there''s no mess of pencils smudges or broken points. The quality of color is wonderful, you can change markings up by however you are holding the pencil and I have found these easier to change up shading with than my usual pencils. My daughter absolutely loves them! She loves being able to twist the colors to her liking instead of having a pencil that's too pointy or too dull. There's 50 colors, a nice wide variety of colors. I plan to use these for my daughter's Art classes this Fall and definitely recommend them!",positive,positive

Not only do they play with it every single day (and ask that we take it with us whenever we go visit family and friends), but all kids around join in too. Quality is excellent (they went through a phase where they would topple their built structures and laugh as they fall, but none of the tiles ever broke, magnets are still strong), colours are beautiful, and they inspire creativity and understanding of structures.",positive,positive

"Obuby Toys for 3-12 Year Old Boys Walkie Talkies for Kids 22 Channels 2 Way Radio Gifts Toys with Backlit LCD Flashlight 3 KMs Range Gift Toys for Age 3 up Boy and Girls to Outside , Hiking, Camping","I  have a 2, 4, & 6 year old, so when we were shopping for fun looking, sturdy, and vibrant walkie talkies for our kids, we came across these. Not only were they on Amazon Prime for quick delivery, but the colors is what really sold us!  No wonder over 5.5K reviews came in with a rating of 4.5 - 5 stars.  Shoot I easily give them 5 stars! The boldness, easy to grip with the rubber finishing and waterproof IPX5 battery compartment, and we love that it has a sturdy clip attachment.  Bonuses are the LED flashlight with variable settings and same goes for the ringing feature. It gives a sense of freedom and confidence when they play outdoors where it is easy to keep track of them when they play in the backyard- I communicate with one unit while the others share the 2 outside.  They are very sturdy as my 2 year old chucked it quite a distance when he got mad at his brother for taking his toy, it still functions great.  My 4 year old purposely ran it over with his bicycle to see what would happen-came out unscathed.  Kids will test and try everything we give them and we know if it sustains their rough play-it is a great investment. It has great range, as we took it camping and the bathrooms from the tentsite was a 3-4 minute walk away and little to no phone reception for any cell carrier, but these came in handy when we went to shower or go to the pool and communicate with family who stayed relaxing at the tentsite. I am looking to purchase these as Christmas gifts or birthday presents.  They are fun to use- ages 3- 12 ; but I use them-and I am a mom of 4 littles. Go and purchase them now before they sell out!",positive,positive
Hygge Games ...I should have known that! Trivia Game Green,"There is nothing wrong with this game.  I want to give it three stars because of my own personal preference when it comes to trivia games, but that would be unfair to the actual product. If you are looking for a game that has somewhat easy questions and a simple point scoring system then this game is for you. This game is perfect for families or for people who aren't super serious about trivia and are just looking for some laod back trivia. I don't meant that disparagingly at all. I'm just a bit of a trivia snob.  I play trivia every week and listen to trivia podcasts, so I'm always looking for trivia games and products that are a bit more difficult. So if you are serious trivia buff this might not be for you.  But if you are just just getting into trivia or just looking for a more relaxed game of trivia this is good purchase at a fair price.",neutral,positive

After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the Picasso tiles for my 3 yr old. He LOVES them (and secretly, we do too). The magnets are strong enough to build some pretty tall structures, but not so hard that my little guy can’t pull the pieces apart by himself. The 100pc set is a good size for making towers and castles, etc. We replicated as best we could the castle in the box. There seem to be just enough pieces to make it. My only complaint - It has an odd number of the large 4-square pieces. I wish they had more and an even amount. *I purchased this product with my own money and my review reflects my honest and unbiased opinion. I hope you find it helpful. Thanks for reading!",positive,positive

Tamagotchi Hello Kitty (42892),"This item isn’t like the original tamagotchi you might have had in the 90s or the new color Tamagotchi Ons (and the like). It’s a nano, or mini tamagotchi, so it’s tiny and the features/functions are limited. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I haven’t had any issues with mine. I preordered several months in advance and have been using it since I received mine at release. Basically the game has 4 functions in addition to the time: feeding, games, cleaning, and turning the light on/off (when your tama sleeps, which they will do at 10pm). Feeding: if your Tama is hungry, you can feed them an apple pie (delivered by Hello Kitty), and if they’re sad, you can offer them milk (also brought by HK). Games: You can play 2 games, a piano and a balloon game. I honestly found these more challenging than the ones on the Tamagotchi Ons/Meets, but maybe that’s bc this device is so tiny. As far as I can tell, unlike in those versions, playing games doesn’t impact your Tama’s happiness. Cleaning: If your tama makes a mess, they’ll chirp and you can then press A to clean up. Light: Once they go to sleep, you can turn the light off. (I’m not sure if leaving it on makes a difference.) That’s about it. While this is a cute device, especially if you’re a fan of Hello Kitty, I’m not sure if it’s the best toy for a child bc of how small it is and how limited the functions are (they may get bored/frustrated quickly). That sad, you can neglect it compared to the Tamagotchi On/Meets for a lot longer, but you also can’t send it to a hotel/babysitter, either. One thing I will say is for such a small device it is LOUD. It also uses special batteries, though so far they seem to last longer than the AAAs do in the Tamagotchi Ons/Meets. I saw people complaining about this not including instructions, but it does. The paper is sandwiched between the layers of cardboard in the packaging, and are in several languages. I’ve included some photos, including one with a ruler and besides the large Tamagotchi On for comparison. It’s about the size of the screen on one of those. (Please note: I’ve added a crochet case to protect it and keep the decals from rubbing off, and I’ve changed the chain to a fabric strap, which are not included.) Overall, I think it’s not bad for $20, and I’m happy with it. Just make sure you know what you’re getting. If you want a more interesting/engaging Tamagotchi, and are a Hello Kitty fan, I would highly recommend importing the Sanrio Meets. It will cost a lot more but is worth it.",positive,positive

My friend and I both have strong science backgrounds (PhD in Mycology and Veterinarian) and we love to help stimulate her very bright 3 yr old granddaughter.  I first read about the product in a WSJ article and immediately went to Amazon Prime to order.  I am definitely buying another set for myself and my wife.  The unlimited possibilities for putting these together in very refreshing - no correct or incorrect outcomes.  I was totally satisfied if there is such a thing with children's toys.  I had tiny concern that the child would be able to push flakes together in the groves, but my friend was sure the child could do it.",positive,positive

She loves using them and she doesn't even realise that she is often working on her fine motor skills and visual perception here. I can see us using this for many years and I am so happy that I stumbled upon this product. We use the yellow tool to transfer pom poms, counting bears etc. The green tool is perfect for having your child learn the motion required to use scissors later on. The dropper tool is fun to have a younger child transfer water from one bowl to another. An older child can use this to learn about color mixing by transferring two different colors and seeing what the mix of colors becomes. This is a great open ended tool that I am glad that I added to my after school kids activity tools.",positive,positive

Her glove looked 2 sizes to big.  The cut of the coat was sloppy. I didn’t want to open the box to examine her dress because she is  going to be in my collection. If I was gifting this to a child I wouldn’t care. The box had some wear on the corners.  This didn’t bother me because she is for  me. I am concerned about the doll  and clothing.

The ship is constructed first and then placed into the bottle. The boat will not snap into its place. It falls apart with any type of force. After reconstructing the boat four times the bricks fall off randomly. The bottle ""glass"" will fall apart with any real force (touching it or maybe breathing near it). Do not get me started on the bottle neck. It falls off on a whim. The base is the only piece that is constructed to Lego standard. I bought the lighting to go with this thing.

The sounds and the motions are fantastic! Patting his head three times has him “using the force” and is so adorable. His eyes close and open flawlessly, and even his cute little ears move. I can’t brag enough about this thing. It makes us smile just turning it on and listening/watching it. Oh, lay it on its back and it goes to sleep making a few Baby Yoda sounds. And yes, I know his name is not Yoda, but we all know “Baby Yoda” has stuck for now. LOL!",positive,positive

It was very useful when we were learning colors and of course now that we're learning fruits and veggies, it's perfect again.  The fruits and vegetables are very durable and attractive.  I'm very pleased with the variety of foods, too.  I had another set of food that was weirdly shiny and downright ugly.  These are cute and easy to identify.  I use the baskets for all kinds of classroom activities as well.  I was SO pleased that the toys come with two sets of labels: one with English and one blank.  Perfect!  I wrote in the Chinese names of all the colors.  I like to avoid English in the classroom as much as possible.  I love, love, love this set.  I have to walk quite a way to teach the Pre-K and K students and the set is light and easy to carry.  The kids just love to hold and fruits and veggies and ask to use them again all the time.",positive,positive

"Stickers for Water Bottles, 100 Pack/PCS Cute Vsco Vinyl Aesthetic Waterproof Stickers Laptop Hydroflask Skateboard Computer Stickers for Teens Kids Girls","I purchased these stickers for my daughter. She put some of them on her water bottle.  I noticed the ones near the top of her water bottle were not adhering so I expect those to come off eventually....especially when the bottle gets wet. My take on these stickers are 1) don’t overlap the stickers as they will not be in 100% contact with a surface, 2) don’t adhere them on a curve or slope of an item because again, part of the sticker will not be in 100% contact. They are nice stickers.  I would still recommend them, but I am not sure yet on how “waterproof” they are.",positive,positive

I then went back and bought more die sets so I could give the game to my daughter and mother.  I am using two yellow die instead of the white as my set didn't come with white.",positive,positive

You can get a game done in about 10-15 minutes so it’s something that they can do while we clean up lunch or something before heading out on the boat – or if you’re just looking to kill a bit of time. Rules are easy enough for everyone to understand and have fun with.  Another bonus is that if you start a game, it’s VERY easy to stop as long as you remember who’s turn it was and start again later.

I've used them a handful of times, and now some of the others have started to peel. Mine are not handled by children, so they're not getting 'rough' treatment. They are the perfect size and the magnetic quality is exceptional. I teach online, so they greatly serve that purpose were it not for the poor quality.",positive,neutral

But, to my surprise, I got a color variant! Instead of the usual red/orange color (cannon colors) I got a maroon foxy! As a collector out to get all of the action figures, it made my day. The only downside was that his left hand/forearm was loose in package. But honestly??? The maroon foxy made it irrelevant. I'm still buzzing with excitement. Definitely worth it!",positive,positive

They are so calming and so fun to play with. I highly recommend these beads for your sensory bins. I cannot wait to use them in my pediatric physical therapy room when I return to work. Just a few beads turns into a bucket full of beads so you do not need to use a lot at once. Just make sure your young kids are supervised when using these beads because they are small even when they expand.,positive,positive

Laughed the entire time it’s crashing into the television or the ceiling. It seems weird that it will just coast along the ceiling for a bit. The sensor works well it keep it up. It would be nice if it had side sensors so it knew it was going to try and take out your television but it doesn’t weigh much so I don’t think it can do much damage to anything but itself.

They’re definitely smaller, but having said that my son was still happy, but I’m not sure if it’s worth $30 as they are only marginally larger than a lot of store bought $3 dinosaurs packages. While these are of better quality, I’m not sure if they’re significantly that much better to warrant the price.

"LOOIKOOS Walkie Talkies for Kids, 3 KMs Long Range Children Walky Talky Handheld Radio Kid Toy Gifts for Boys and Girls 3 Pack","The sound quality is terrific. My daughter has covid and was getting really lonely in quarantine. I gave one to her and the other two to two other kids in the neighborhood, and within an hour, they were all waving at her through her window. You wouldn’t think something as simple as a walkie could create such a heartwarming moment. I think the kids will continue to use them even after quarantine. They get a kick out of being able to talk to each other even after the street lights come on and they have to go home. It brings back such vivid memories of growing up in the nineties. I’m happy they were so easy to use and very impressed with the quality",positive,positive

"BARWA 32 pcs Doll Clothes and Accessories 10 pcs Party Dresses 22 pcs Shoes, Crown, Necklace Accessories for 11.5 inch Doll","Welp, there's a reason this pack is so cheap. Firstly, this may work for more 'classic' Barbies. I got my daughter some of the Fashionistas and Career line, which feature flatter feet and (ever so slightly) wider figures. So the shoes in this pack are worthless straight out of the pack, for us. The clothing is super cheap. Shoulder straps ripped right out of the bag, velcro coming loose the first time I tried putting a dress on one of her Barbies. The fit is, as I mentioned, too thin for the Barbies we have. The jewelry pieces are super cheap, too. I mean, I realize we're talking about Barbie jewelry. It's got the traditional space in the back, where it goes around the doll's neck. The very first one I did, snapped. Mind you, I'm an adult, showing my 5 year old how it was done. I felt horrible for ruining part of her toy, but I guess grateful it happened to me and not her first, so she didn't feel like she did something wrong.",negative,negative

Czech Games Codenames,"This game gets you thinking about how you can link words together and do it faster than the other team.  With only one-word clues, it helps you become more thoughtful with your words.  There are almost endless combinations too so you'll never play the same game twice.  For those of you who hate games that are left to chance, this is a good game for you because it relies on brainpower. The only downside is you need at least four people to play, so it's great for groups but not for two people.",positive,positive
"Tara Toys Disney Princess Necklace Activity Set, 9.7x8.18x2","This product would have been adorable for my 3 year old.

"12 Pack of 7 Dinosaur Toy Figures with Educational Dinosaur Book, Large Plastic Dinosaur Toys Set for Toddlers, Kids, Boys and Girls","I am really disappointed in these toys for so very many reason. First of all, these are obviously two pieces glued together and in some cases really poorly glued together (they don’t really line up). Also there are some dinos that the glue has seeped past the line where they attach. Secondly, the Dino’s were supposed to be 7” many of these are barely 6. Lastly, most of these guys don’t stand up which is a total bummer. I hope I can return these - they really aren’t worth spending any money on.",negative,negative

"Hasbro Gaming Rubik's 3X3 Cube, Puzzle Game, Classic Colors","I played with cubes 30 years ago and never had the patience to figure them out. These modern cubes are dramatically easier to turn and manipulate with no break-in period required. Head on over to the official website and follow their instructions. It took me about 15 minutes the first time, but I've been steadily improving my time - my son learned how to do it too! Every time we encountered a old or non-Rubik's cubes (at my parent's home, friend's homes, party favors from birthday parties) I'm frustrated by how difficult things used to be. The color faces are colored plastic and not stickers, so you don't need to worry about wear and tear. Recommended!",positive,positive

This is one of the most expensive Lego sets I've ever bought. Big disappointment. Lego quality has gone way down hill.",negative,negative
Melissa & Doug Cutting Fruit Set - Wooden Play Food Kitchen Accessory,My toddler loves to play with this. He likes to mix and match the fruit and use the wooden knife to “cut” them. Its all wood so is very sturdy and safe. It’s also been a great way to teach him about different fruits and to make them seem less “scary” when giving them to him to eat.,positive,positive
Hanes Men's Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt Value Pack (4-pack),"I have these shirts that I bought from a local department store and I ended up really liking these shirts, so I wanted to get some more as I try to do minimalism where I wear the same shirt every day. I went back to the original store but they didn't have them anymore so I thought I would try Amazon since Amazon has everything. I ordered these as their description matches the shirts I have exactly, but the shirts I received are completely different. 1. The feel of the fabric sucks on the shirts I received. 2. The shirts I received had tags on them, even though the description says tagless. 3. The fit of the shirts was not the same: chest was looser, arms were looser, etc. I went ahead and bought the correct shirts from Hanes.com as I didn't want to deal with this anymore. I would advise anyone trying to find good Hanes shirts to go in store or order from Hanes.com",negative,negative

"UNO Family Card Game, with 112 Cards in a Sturdy Storage Tin, Travel-Friendly, Makes a Great Gift for 7 Year Olds and Up [Amazon Exclusive]","I first got Phase 10 when my own kids were young. I've played it with kids as young as 5 or 6 who know numbers and their order.  Now I play it not only with  my grandchildren, but with my grown children, too. It's so much fun!  Learning the game is easy; there are no complicated rules. In each round your goal is different- you may need to get cards in number order or many copies of one number, or a combination of both. The length of a game is probably over half an hour, but it's able to be stopped after any round without feeling like you stopped 'in the middle'. I've given this as a gift many times and it's always enjoyed.  Especially with families staying home more now a days;  how much screen time do we really  need?  Family game time gives us a way to interact in a competitive yet friendly way. My local store doesn't always carry this because games and toys seem to follow fads, so it's good that Amazon has it whenever I need to buy a new one.",positive,positive

Desire Deluxe Magnetic Tiles Blocks Building Set for Kids – Learning Educational Toys for Boys Girls for Age 3 - 8 Year-Old – Birthday Present Gift (57PC),"Me and 3yo daughter spend hours on this. Love that we can build so many different projects. Cons:  magnets often repel as the poles are the same many times and thus don’t always stick in the position you put them in. Also they flap down many times which is annoying and then they stick to the other magnets which requires you to pry them apart often breaking the project you just built. Otherwise, not a big issue and don’t want to detract potential buyers as the product is a great price and leads to awesome cognitive exercises.  Makes a wonderful gift!",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Food Groups - 21 Wooden Pieces and 4 Crates,"For our daughter's first birthday we purchased her a KidCraft Deluxe Let's Cook Kitchen set, so we obviously needed to buy some play food to accompany it. We love Melissa & Doug products, so does our little one. This food set is cute, it has a nice variety for a one year old and best of all it's wooden. Plastic food is tough, most is flimsy and cheap. I will say that our child loves this, she plays, chews on, and throws it. I noticed a hairline crack in one of the hamburger bun pieces, nothing that is causing it to split, but disappointing none the less. Despite that small defect (which happened within a month of use) we plan on buying more of the Melissa & Doug food sets for her to play with. They're just a better choice from what we found, I have yet to find a decent plastic set. If you have any suggestions/recommendations on a nice plastic play food set please let me know! I just don't want to spend money on flimsy plastic food, or sets that have cardboard pieces. I mean the cardboard pieces are useless and won't hold up for more than 10mins in my house. All in all, I say as far as play food options go, this is the best.",positive,positive

His creations are more elaborate and involved now but his interest has not waned at all over the past 11 months. The tiles have had hard use and are still good as new. Best money I ever spent on a kid’s gift so far!,positive,positive
"Pokémon Assorted Cards, 50 Pieces","I am very disappointed in this purchase. Out of the 50 cards in the order, we only received 22 unique cards, including 8 energy cards. That means there were only 14 unique character or trainer cards out of 50!  My child was very excited to jump-start her Pokémon card collection, but this was a complete waste of money and highly disappointing. After reading the fine print, it is spelled out that there *will* be duplicates in your order and that there is no maximum or minimum number of duplicates.  In other words, it is within their rights to ship you, say, 50 copies of one card. This item is also *not* returnable, so no matter how egregious the duplicates, you will be stuck with it. My order was fulfilled by The Game Capital, so I can only comment on this particular vendor and order. However, look closely at the fine print of this item and be aware that my experience would be considered ""normal"".  This feels like a way for shops to dump their undesirable cards and have a CYA statement to cover them legally (but not necessarily morally). TLDR; Avoid purchasing this. There are other slightly more expensive options here on Amazon that are far more satisfying.",negative,negative

SET Enterprises Five Crowns Card Game Purple,We’ve been playing this game for about 20 years now. It is a family favorite and everyone we’ve introduced it to outside of our family has bought a deck for themselves. Our children are all now in their 20’s and we still play it during every holiday and vacation. We have a digital scoreboard and running tally of wins. It’s simple and allows for conversation and camaraderie; and - if you’re playing with adults - variations that involve libations are super simple to come up with!  ;^P,positive,positive
"Hatchimals Pixies, Crystal Flyers Starlight Idol Magical Flying Pixie Toy with Lights, Kids Toys for Girls Ages 6 and up","This was a big disappointment. The fairy drone takes off but because it flies sideways it inevitably bumps something then comes crashing down. We've had other drone toys with sensors that allow the toy to avoid crashes from flying into things. This fairy toy can't do that. I suspect it does not have sensors to allow this. So, you get a few moments of hovering before it crashes down... No Fun & left my daughter very disappointed. We are sending it back.",negative,negative

I can no longer use them and I need to buy new even though these are barely sharpened down. I like pencils to be super pointed for detailed coloring and artistic use. I have used these consistently for a year. None are allowing me to sharpen them. One or two is understandable, but all seems odd to me.",negative,neutral

I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. My son is a very gentle kid and these couldn't even withstandhim playing with them. I can't imagine they would last minutes with a rougher kid. They both broke in the same exact spot. I'm guessing a weak area in the handle. Once they were broken in half they left sharp pieces and exposed wires. I would never recommend this product to anybody. They are definitely dollar store quality.,negative,negative

It was definitely not what I was expecting and I ultimately returned it. The questions are more geared towards people who are just getting to know eachother. It just wasn't for us and what I was specifically looking for but I do think it would be good for people who are still getting to know about eachother.",negative,neutral

I took a picture of the packaging and a coloring page I did with my kids of All the colors included. Some of the markers seem to be a repeat of colors even though on the back they look different. But we had a lot of fun and my daughter loves them and that's what's important.,positive,positive

All those traits are important to me when I pick a game to play. Pro tip: Laminate some of the scorecards and use dry erase markers to keep score. When you're finished with a game simply use a dry erase eraser or cloth to remove the ink.",positive,positive

Dig a Dozen Dino Egg Dig Kit - Easter Egg Dinosaur Toys for Kids - Dig up 12 Eggs & Discover Surprise Dinosaurs. Science STEM Activities - Educational Gifts for Boys & Girls Age 3-5 5-7 8-12 Year Old,"This product was a fun activity for a 3yo who loves dinosaurs. I spread finding and excavating the eggs out over a week to keep her from being overwhelmed by a dozen eggs all at once. Everything about it was really enjoyable for her and for me until the last day when we got an egg that had the same dinosaur (anklosaurus instead of corythosaurus) inside that she had already ""discovered"" a few days earlier. We were both very disappointed not to have a full set to match her cards, but thankfully her favorite dinosaur and not the duplicate was in the very last egg we opened. Decent product overall, but quality control needs some work.",neutral,positive
Czech Games Codenames: Duet - The Two Player Word Deduction Game,This game is pointless. There is no winner or loser. There’s no point in buying this.

"Stickers for Kids, 3D Puffy Stickers, 64 Different Sheets, 3200+ Stickers, Including Animals, Cars, Airplane, Food, Letters, Flowers, Pets, Cakes and Tons More","My 2 and 5 year olds love them. The stickers are a little smaller than I expected, but they are really cute and everything you can think of is represented in them. One thing I didn’t expect is that the sheets are scored, and tend to fall apart when you lift them. But we like to include little sticker sheets when doing things like valentines or Halloween grab bags for preschool, and quickly figured out that these will be perfect for things like that. We’re rapidly getting through this pack at home, but I’m ordering more to have on hand for adding to gifts and cards for the kids’ friends.",positive,positive

Neato! 41-Piece Pick-Up Sticks Game,"If you're used to playing the game with plastic pick-up sticks the wooden Toysmith version will take a bit of adjustment on your part. Toysmith's 41 piece set is nothing more than wooden painted dowels about two times the width of the plastic sticks. The wooden sticks appear uniform to the eye but once they're dropped into the playing pile you'll notice that they hesitate and sit a bit awkward on top of one another. Also, on a color note,the black stick is a little difficult to discern from the dark blue stick which makes for a bit of confusion some times. All in all, the sticks do just fine for average game play and can occupy the time of even the pickiest computer obsessed kid.",neutral,neutral
"Pokémon Assorted Cards, 50 Pieces","I purchased these for one of my sons. I normally read reviews, but didn't think to do so for some stupid Pokemon cards. I ended up ordering a couple sets. I went to return this set and it said they were not returnable. That's when I looked at the reviews. He ended up opening them and the first two cards were dupes! After sorting thru them, he ended up with 21 different cards and 29 duplicates! Some of them had 4-6 of the same card. The other package I ordered (from another vendor) only had 1 set of dupes. I know there's always a chance of getting duplicates, but this is RIDICULOUS!",negative,negative
Hasbro Gaming: Jenga Classic Game,its hard to find a game easy enough for the 6 and under crowd that isnt boring for the adults but this one is a classic and my daughter thinks it is so much fun she also plays blocks with it building towers.  here i was spending hundreds on christmas and what do you know this inexpensive board game takes the cake as one of her favorite gifts i think it good for concentrations as well she is a smart little girl so she wins half the time leaving the tower toppling down on the rest of us it fun to see you dont have to spend a lot to have a good time.,positive,positive
"LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Luigi Starter Course 71387 Building Kit; Collectible Toy Playset for Creative Kids, New 2021 (280 Pieces)","Two of the greatest names in entertainment and quality have come together! I know this is not the first collaborative set, but it holds true to the quality and value that both of these companies have always demonstrated. The build quality and ease of instructions is just as simple to use and follow as Lego has always made their products. And if you love Nintendo like I do, then this is a home run for you. This is actually the first Nintendo themed products that myself and my children argue over ownership of :P. I want to put in on display, and they want to play with it! This is a collectible for sure.",positive,positive

"LEGO Creator Mighty Dinosaurs 31058 Build It Yourself Dinosaur Set, Create a Pterodactyl, Triceratops and T Rex Toy (174 Pieces)","Nice Set.  The kids love it, although, it does break fairly easily, so I've spend many a night putting it back together for them.  My 5 year old was able to put the first half together, then it got a little too complex for him, so I helped him with the rest.  I think it's a pretty good value for the price set though.",positive,positive

Czech Games Codenames: Duet - The Two Player Word Deduction Game,Great game! But this instead of the original code names! It can be used with original rules with simple changes. This was a huge hit with our extended family who do not play board games as much. It definitely always takes us longer than the time it is supposed to though. It does require quite a bit of thinking though. So keep that in mind.,positive,positive
"Crayola Washable Paint, Assorted Colors, 16 Ounces, 12 Count","My daughter loves to paint, she’s almost 3yo now, it’s a new thing for her... although some of the caps were broken in pieces I dnt mind, it still serves its purpose and keeps the paint from drying up... what I love most is it washes right off, doesn’t leave a single mark or residue on my kiddos when they get paint on themselves, but be careful becuz sadly it won’t wash off clothing... but I will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out of paint...",positive,positive

Yahtzee,"Just like the classic Yahtzee. The only different is the cup used to shake the dice. The red cup from the original game has been replaced by an odd-shaped container. It doesn't effect gameplay at all. The hole in this container is smaller, so it's less likely to send dice flying across the room. Great family night game. Appropriate for ages 7+ because it requires some basic math skills (addition and simple multiplication)",positive,positive

Due to the photos and description I was under the impression I was buying a decent makeup set for my 6 year old. When this package came in I was more than surprised to see how small the package was, but still have it the benefit of the doubt and wrapped it anyways hoping maybe there would be lots of makeup and drawers hidden in There, I should have known better. When my daughter unwrapped her gift and opened it up, it was unbelievably tiny, only a few makeup choices AND TO ADD TO THE JOY OF THIS PURCHASE, more than one makeup pallet was broken into powder!!! I paid way too much for what we received, and that’s putting it nicely!!!!",negative,negative
"Crayola My First Safety Scissors, Toddler Art Supplies, 3ct","I got these to use with playdoh so I wasn’t concerned with the reviews that say they don’t work on paper. They work great for playdoh but my 4 year old discovered they work great on paper, too. (Luckily it was her art paper so she was allowed to be cutting it.) And they were so stinking cheap. They’ve seen weekly use for the past 4 months (and survived being dropped to the floor about 10 times each crafting session) and they’re still working perfectly.",positive,positive

Czech Games Codenames,"I love this game and I've given it as a gift to several people, including families with kids as young as 8.  I've actually never met anyone who doesn't like it -- and most of us love it.  The grid of 5x5 words constantly changes, giving you new words to try to connect.  It works for parties of more than 4 because you just divide into 2 relatively equal teams.  The words the designers chose to include are perfect because most have more than one meaning, giving you lots of options.  It's a great gift, a fun time and I just don't know how it couldn't be a hit.  Totally buy it. *don’t be discouraged if it takes a few times to get the hang of it.  It’s worth it.",positive,positive

"Tara Toys Disney Princess Necklace Activity Set, 9.7x8.18x2","My daughter gave this as a present for her friend's birthday. She loved it so so so much, she requested it a month later for her own birthday! It's a cute crafty necklace, but one semi large downfall is the way to take the necklace on and off also allows all of the beads to fall right off! I wish there was a way to tie it off. So when she took it off and dropped one end, every single bead fell off. I'm going to try to find some sort of stopper bead. No clue if this exists or not. But she loves the princesses and loved making them. The princesses were cute too.",positive,positive
"Rock Painting Kit for Kids - Arts and Crafts for Girls & Boys Ages 6-12 - Craft Kits Art Set - Supplies for Painting Rocks - Best Tween Paint Gift, Ideas for Kids Activities Age 4 5 6 7 8 9 10","The listing shows exactly what is included and if that is what you want go for it. A better option is to buy some acrylic craft paints, brushes and rub-on transfers at your local dollar store. You can find your own rocks or bring a bucket to your landscape supply and fill it up for a few bucks. All that will cost you less than this kit and will be enough to paint dozens of rocks. The paints in this kit are poor quality, not washable and bad for the environment. If you plan to hide your painted rocks outdoors it is important to seal them with a UV resin, varnish or clear spray coating. That will protect the paint from fading or washing off and won't cause environmental damage.",neutral,neutral

Play-Doh Party Pack 10 1oz Cans of Assorted Color,"My son typically loves Playdough; he's three so he's pretty easy to please. He opened this package in his Christmas stocking, luckily I distracted him enough not to ruin his holiday, but one of the green playdoughs was rock solid, smelled funky, and had white growths all over it. Honestly, WTF playdough?! Poor little dude is 3 and already dealing with drunk Santa??? What gives? So... We probably won't be ordering much Playdough anymore but one thing is for certain we will NOT be GIFTING Playdough ever again. Disappointed hugely.",negative,negative
"LEGO Ideas Ship in a Bottle 92177 Expert Building Kit, Snap Together Model Ship, Collectible Display Set and Toy for Adults (962 Pieces)","I love everything about this set, except the packaging. I'm not sure whether to blame the shipping or the packaging from LEGO, but when I received it, 2 of the 4 big glasses pieces has visible scratches on it that can't be erased. This is a bit disappointing since those scratches will be very visible and it is supposed to be brand new. Other than that though, this is certainly a solid build. I LOVE the small ship design, it is surprisingly detailed and pleasing to the eyes. Tbh, I would've bought this just for this ship model alone. All in all a very creative and fun set to build for a very reasonable price! A solid buy in my opinion, despite the potential scratches from packaging/shipping.",positive,positive

The ink is all a blue UV reflective color, not different colors that match the exterior color of the marker. The built in lights are weak, but all worked as expected out of the package.

What Do You Meme? Core Game - The Hilarious Adult Party Game for Meme Lovers,"I gave it four stars because a third of the game is VERY inappropriate for my tastes. Although, I’m sure others would enjoy that. I took all the “inappropriate” ones out for my family and we have NEVER laughed so hard. I even got my uncle to play and he never plays games. Once the concept of a meme was explained it was so funny. I originally got it for my husband, who loves memes, but now it’s one of my favorite games. It reminds me of a modern apples to apples with pictures. LOVE IT.",positive,positive

The stickers are mostly cute, sweet and fun other than a couple pages dedicated to garbage and potty type stickers which seem out of place in an otherwise cute book. I try to teach my children to find better forms of humor and speech so it was disappointing to me, but nothing I can’t get rid of on my own. It just seems out of place and certainly something I don’t want to waste my money on. There are also a few other stickers throughout that seem out of place such as underwear with a day of the week written on them. Another disappointing sticker refers to God’s name in vain. I recognize that we all see religion differently and that is one of the many beautiful things about the freedoms in this country, however there is still a standard of respect that could be maintained better by all of us and needs not find place in a seemingly innocent book of cute stickers.",negative,neutral

I expected thin plastic thay would deform easily and I was wrong. Theres a rubber coating that is strong enough to withstand the bite of a 2 year old. Unsure how long of a durability as I immediately correct biting of objects that are not eatible. Larger than I expected which was also a major plus. Colors of items are somewhat realistic that comes to be slightly confusing when sorting, for example, the corn on the cob has the green casing but yellow corn. Overall I was ecstatic over this product when we opened it. Amazing for teaching colors as well as identifying foods.",positive,positive

Robo Alive Junior Baby Shark Battery-Powered Sing and Swim Bath Toy by ZURU - Baby Shark (Yellow),I was in a pinch for Christmas and bought this for my baby shark lover off amazon.

When I recieved it I was so happy at what I recieved and I was very surprised how BIG it really is. I purchased this on amazon prime day because it was almost half price. Original price is $50 and I paid $28 which is GREAT. I bought it to put away for Christmas so they havent even seen it yet but I personally love it and as a mother I am excited to play with it too! I have 4 children, 10, 5, 4 and 9 months. My girls LOVE to play pretend and this is my first Melissa & Doug product ever and now it will not be the last. It seems to be very,very well made and from what I can see it seems to be all wooden because it is fairly heavy. It is cute because it comes with the scooper and the toppings are separate so you can mix and match. I would absolutely 100% recommend this for any child who spends all day playing pretend. I would even seriously consider paying the full amount for it too!",positive,positive

One minor detail I noticed was all of the dinosaurs looked like they been split in half (vertically) & glued back together. You can see the line of separation & the glue that was used. I just washed all of them & it stayed in tact. Not a complete deal breaker, but I took a star for that. Pretty durable & with my kid being who he is, thats a plus!",positive,positive

Hasbro Gaming: Battleship Classic Board Game Strategy Game Ages 7 and Up For 2 Players,"I purchased battleship for my 7 year old daughter. This was one of my favorite games growing up playing with my mom and brother, and had to bring it into our collection now that my daughter is getting older. Its definitely a newer version with the same concept, and I dont think improved. The pins and ships are always popping out if youre not careful on the bottom of the board. It is not sealed off which is a bummer. It always seems they never give enough white pins. However my 7 year old is obsessed and loves it. Its a great game for learning tactics, and graphs in a fun competitive way. ,",positive,positive

"RenFox Kids Musical Mats, Music Piano Keyboard Dance Floor Mat Carpet Animal Blanket Touch Playmat Early Education Toys for Baby Girls Boys(43.3x14.2in)","My 15 months old son liked it, not the music, but the blinking lights. This is not an issue with the product, I think once he gets older he will be able to play it the way it is designed to be played. However, I do wish the back of the keyboard is a non-slippery surface, because when my son walks over it it moved and he lost his balance then fall. Also, when there's a big movement to the mat, like if it got picked up by the kid, the keyboard stops working. I had to turn it off then turn it back on for it to function normal again.",neutral,positive

They are very easy to use and I’m impressed with the sound quality, there is very little static that comes through so it is easy to understand what the person on the other end is saying.

Tamagotchi Star Wars: R2-D2 Classic White (88821),"What I love: It’s an R2D2 tamagotchi. What I don’t love: HOW TINY IT IS. I pre-ordered this little guy and was excited he’d arrive on my birthday, but just the size alone is making me reconsider the purchase. It’s adorable, yes, but it’s probably going to end up being a $20 keychain on a bag or backpack because it’s certainly nothing like the tamagotchis I remember owning. I’ll give it another day or two before I decide whether I’ll  return it or not…",neutral,neutral

Melissa & Doug Wooden Pizza Play Food Set With 36 Toppings,"I got this for my 4 year-old grandson for Christmas, and I've recently had the opportunity to visit and see him playing with it firsthand. He LOVES it. He is ""making pizza"" several times a day and has even picked up that his uncle doesn't like mushrooms and leaves those off his slice! The toy is exceptionally well made; no stickers that will peel off and no rough edges. The velcro that attaches the toppings to the pizza is also very sturdy. The serving pieces are nice surprise. Very realistic and built well for small hands. One of the things I found ingenious was that the pizza pieces velcro together in the pan, so when it child ""slices"" the pizza, there is some resistance which really adds to the imaginative play! I would not hesitate to purchase this again. I love Melissa and Doug toys and was thrilled to see their quality has not deteriorated like so many other things these days. There ARE a lot of pieces, but so what? That's part of having kids. At least they are quality, sturdy pieces!",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Food Groups - 21 Wooden Pieces and 4 Crates,"Because of the anticipated toy shortage for Christmas this year, I proactively bought my daughter’s big gift early. I purchased this set of food after a lot of research about the durability and safety of various brands of food. I have a golden retriever, so I knew felt food would attract his hair. While I can’t yet say if this food will last, it is very cute and somewhat as described. I didn’t need the specific crates shown in the stock photos, but I could see where if you did, you might be mad. I received solid, square crates instead of the open, rectangular ones shown (see attached photos to see what I received). For this reason, I deducted a star because again, it could be a real problem. They seem high quality, but I will update after some use. No pieces appear to be a choking hazard which I very much appreciate! Great little starter set.",positive,positive
Melissa & Doug Scoop and Stack Ice Cream Cone Magnetic Pretend Play Set,"This little ice cream set is super cute!  The scoops of ice cream stick to the scooper, the cones, etc which is super cool.  However all of the accessories dont fit into the ice cream carton which could be expanded to the size of an actual carton size easily.  Thus you have some ice cream, the ice cream scoop or comes laying out.  Adorable play set so I'll keep it.",positive,positive
Got2Glow Fairy Finder - Electronic Fairy Jar Catches Virtual Fairies - Got to Glow (Pink),"The media could not be loaded. Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I thought this would be right up her alley - she's 5 and into fairies, unicorns, princess, glitter...  We've been using it just over 24 hours and I'm already burnt out. The jar itself is very cute. The screen is old school. It lights up with different colors, but the fairies show up as black pixelated shapes. The fairies that show up on the jar screen don't match the same shapes as the fairies in the app (more about the app later). When you catch a fairy, it doesn't show up in the order in which they were caught. When you catch a new one, you have to scroll through all your fairies to find it (if you or your child can remember which one) so you can add it to the app. They actually show up in the order that they appear in the app on the collector sheet. There are 3 buttons that serve different purposes; however, there are too many presses that need to happen for a 5 year old. Let's face it, I'm doing most of the work outside of her catching the fairies. Also, it seems glitchy because when in fairy finding mode, when the jar signals that a fairy is caught, many times it turns out to be a fairy we already have (but doesn't add it again into the collection). On the other had, we did catch 4 of the same fairy which have been added to the collection. We've walked all over trying new places. Not sure what the issue is. Now a out the app - it is a pain. To keep track of which fairies you have and learn about them, you have to have it. My (newly turned) 5 year old cannot read to learn about them on her own, nor take notes in the section available to add them. Let's talk about adding fairies to the collector sheet... it is a major pain. I'm using an Amazon Fire tablet and it is so frustrating trying to scan the QR code (each fairy has one and it's the only way to add). The QR code doesn't stay on the screen long enough. The tablet has a hard time scanning it. Takes 3-4 tries at times, which involves a lot of extra button pushing, scanning through fairies, etc.. Perhaps better suited for a slightly older age with some patience and access to a smart device.",neutral,neutral
Melissa & Doug Created by Me! Heart Box Wooden Craft Kit,"I bought this for my 6 year old grand daughter as a Christmas gift. She was so excited when she opened it.

Ticket to Ride Board Game | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Train Game | Ages 8+ | For 2 to 5 players | Average Playtime 30-60 minutes | Made by Days of Wonder,"Ticket to Ride is one of those games that I've always heard about but never actually tried, so I bought it for me and my 9 year old to play. We loved the Alexa set up and guided play. The only problem is that at one point Alexa says something like ""If you need help just say Alexa.."" but her own voice triggered her and we got stuck in a loop for a few minutes. (When she says her name, just yell TICKETS or something loudly enough that it doesn't directly trigger her listening). The background train noises were pretty cool, and it was nice to not have to worry about keeping track of points. Now I wish other games also had a vocal app tie -in. The game itself was easy enough that we got right into playing (although the first time Alexa does guide you thru the rules) and I think when my husband plays with us we'll be able to just explain it to him fairly quickly. The two player variant left a lot of room for routes but you can definitely see that 3 or more players will have you thinking a little more strategically about how to chose your routes. We were able to play this game together and have a conversation, so even though the game is pretty much what you see it has pretty good replayable value since we can do it while we discuss things or talk about our day, etc.",positive,positive
What Do You Meme? Core Game - The Hilarious Adult Party Game for Meme Lovers,"My brother wanted this crap, but we only played it once (jerk) lol.

"Crayola Colored Pencils Adult Coloring Set, Gift, 100 Count","The Crayola 100 Different Color Pencil Package is a great buy for a beginning adult colorist who doesn’t want to spend big money seeing if she really likes coloring or not. These pencils offer very good color choices in pencils with a good feel in the hand. They lay down color well according to the paper they are being used on like any other pencil does. They blend fairly well. No, they aren't the very expensive top-of-line pencils, but they are more than adequate and may become your pencil of choice. Please use a good sharpener on any pencil and sharpen gently. Hand-held sharpeners generally work best. They travel compactly in the box they come in. Pencil choices are very personal, so I recommend starting with these pencils unless you can afford to determine your liking of coloring with the big brands. These were packaged well with no breakage.",positive,positive

She also has an older sister that has cerebral palsy, and she understands that her sisters muscles don't work like other kids. She loves being able to see all the different layers of the body. **One thing that caught me off guard was the different boy and girl parts. The organs and skin layers have girl parts and boy parts.** Wasn't a big deal for me, as we have always taught the atomically correct names for boys and girls private parts, and my kids understand the differences between them.

Hasbro Gaming Rubik's Cube 3 x 3 Puzzle Game for Kids Ages 8 and Up,Packaging was very plain and I did not feel was good for gifting. Cube itself was a bit “loose”. It did not have that tight new Rubik’s cube feel. My son actually rotated one of the corner pieces in an attempt to “cheat” and it took a very frustrating day to figure out why it suddenly became unsolvable. I started to question my life on multiple levels before he finally came clean and told me what he did. The cube shouldn’t be loose enough to allow for that.,negative,positive
Melissa & Doug Birthday Party Cake - Wooden Play Food With Mix-n-Match Toppings and 7 Candles,I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! She makes a cake everyday.

I ordered two light pads for granddaughters, and I believe the girls will enjoy them. However, upon receiving my order I was surprised at myself, that I had spent $24 on this item. Call me old fashioned, but for that price I'd like to see my item arrive in primo condition. One pad has a big scratch on the screen, which will likely not affect function so much as it's unsightly. Second, the paper is wavy and wrinkled. Were I the young artist, I'd want my materials to be spanking new, no scratches, and flat beautiful art paper. Cheaply made product, but I suppose it'd be difficult to find another product for less.",negative,neutral

Hanes Men's Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt Value Pack (4-pack),"I received these shirts about 1 month ago, have washed/worn them no more than 2-3 times. They are already falling apart at the seams. My guess is that they are not actually Hanes at all but fakes. I want my money back but it's already been more than 1 month. Update - 2.5 months in and 3 of the 4 shirts have fallen apart.  I had bought ""the same"" product in 2017 (I used ""buy again"" from my Orders history) and all 4 of those three-year-old shirts are still in tact, just very faded.  So something has obviously changed quite drastically and Amazon, while apologetic for my situation, does not seem terribly interested in my experience.  $15 completely wasted.",negative,negative

Melissa & Doug Wooden Scoop and Serve Ice Cream Counter (28 pcs) - Play Food and Accessories,"Just got ours after seeing how much my son loved playing with this at friends’ houses. Tore open the package to find that the scooper doesn’t work! Ice cream scoops simply slip right out. The scooper won’t grab or lock into place as if the hole is too big or the locking mechanism is broke. Since we tore open the package, I don’t know how we can even return it. Read that a replacement scooper isn’t available for purchase alone. So disappointed since scooping ice cream is what it’s all about! Another flaw: there’s no place for the money or menu. Still gave 2 stars because the concept is good, design not so much. My 3 yr old son still plays with it using his hands to scoop and serve.",negative,negative
Czech Games Codenames: Duet - The Two Player Word Deduction Game,"My husband and I bought this game as something fun to do for our date nights that didn't involve leaving the house.  We really enjoy it!  It gives us something cooperative to do and we both enjoy puzzles and riddles, so this is a challenge to try to think of something the other person with understand.  It also opens up a lot of conversation, when one of us gives a clue that makes the other scratch their heads a go, ""what???""  There are also pretty much endless possibilities for word combinations and some of them just crack us up!  We would highly recommend this game!",positive,positive
"Play-Doh Modeling Compound 10-Pack Case of Colors, Non-Toxic, Assorted, 2 oz. Cans, Ages 2 and up, Multicolor (Amazon Exclusive)","We received all the colors shown the the image displayed. However, I did not read the description closely to realize how small the tubs of Play-Doh are. Even if I had I would have not made the connection that these are about 1/3 of the size of your standard Play-Doh containers. I'm totally okay with this though because my kids tend to leave their Play-Doh out if I am not keeping a close eye on them (especially the two year old) so if they do forget to put it away or mix the colors together it is not a large amount of dough ruined. These are great stocking stuffer or gift bag sized cans and I think even with the smaller containers they are reasonably priced.",neutral,positive
"LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box 10698 Build Your Own Creative Toys, Kids Building Kit (790 Pieces)","The LEGO bricks speak for themselves.  The packaging is another matter.  The plastic tub (shaped like a LEGO brick) does not close and lock properly.  There are studs on each side of the lid that should match the locks in the tub.  They match, but do not lock.  If it were not for the paper wrap, the contents would have spilled out in shipping.  I thought they had their act together.  I guess there is still room for improvement.",negative,neutral

"LEGO Chain Reactions (Klutz Science/STEM Activity Kit), 9"" Length x 1.06"" Width x 10"" Height",*Before I start my review I must say you will have to have some legos already to do some of the builds in this book.* With that being said... My kid loves this book. We’ve made two builds so far. It kept my 6yo’s attention the entire time and being able to use the legos already in the house was exciting. Easy and awesome way to teach your kid physics. :),positive,positive

Then on day two they dance and sang and one of them dropped the microphone and the top broke off, I was able to glue it back on, however the next time it got dropped the cover for the controls split and broke off, all the little slider buttons scattered, it was over then. So while this is rated 3 to 15, my kids are 8, 9 and 13, and it still got dropped while singing and dancing. So if you buy this maybe get a pool noodle and wrap the ring around it to make it a bit more bouncy!",neutral,neutral

"Melissa & Doug Puffy Sticker Play Set - On the Farm - 52 Reusable Stickers, 2 Fold-Out Scenes","Very cute and great for travel or a time that you want your child to sit quietly. However, my 5 y/o was very quick to set up the stickers in each of the scenes and then be done. The removable and slightly 2-D stickers stay put well,  but almost too well, to easily change scenes. Once she put all the stickers on, she was done. * TIP: save the clear plastic sheets that the stickers come on so that later you can remove them yourself from the scenes and be able to get many more uses. We also have 2 other sets of this product and feel the same about all of them—great for a time when you want independent play and it’s easy to transport! This was a great buy, even for the price, and who can dispute Melissa & Doug??",positive,positive

It was supposed to be one of my daughters Christmas presents, but I could not wait to give it to her. When she opened it, I was so impressed with the quality of the pots and pans. I am so glad I researched and chose these because they are very well made. They are not that thin cheap metal. These pots and pans are made of good thick metal and are just the perfect size for my daughter's new kitchen. My mom said, ""Wow, those look like they could be used on a real stove."" Lol! I would definitely recommend these!!",positive,positive

Do not waste your money on this. My six year old was so excited to try this out on Christmas after opening it but within first 15 minutes it wouldn't recognize the micro SD card that came with it so it wouldn't take any pictures. I tried a brand new nice Samsung Micro SD after formating it and it wouldn't recognize that either. The picture quality is terrible too. Get a cheap camera from a real brand like Polaroid.,negative,negative

They’re  the perfect size for little ones just getting into playdoh. I’m very brave in letting my two year old play with it, but the amount in each container is a great place to start exploring without giving them too much. All three of my girls are sharing the loot and they’re loving all the different colors. Will definitely buy more when the time comes.",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Let's Play House! Grocery Cans Play Food Kitchen Accessory - 10 Stackable Cans With Removable Lids,"Got these for my daughter on Amazon when they were having a sale on Melissa & Doug stuff, so we only payed $6.99 for them.  I ordered them because my 21 month old daughter loves to get into the cabinets and play with real cans, which is not good because we worry about her dropping them on her hands or feet.  So we decided this would be a great way to allow her to play with cans that aren't heavy or hurt her.  The best part is she can take the lids of the top & put stuff in them, which is something she really enjoys doing.  I think she is going to enjoy them and get a ton of use out of them.",positive,positive

"Elongdi Water Beads Pack Rainbow Mix 50,000 Beads Growing Balls, Jelly Water Gel Beads for Spa Refill, Kids Sensory Toys , Vases, Plant, Wedding and Home Decor",Put a rimmed pan under your work area when you open the bottle to catch any strays.  The packaging leaves a bit to be desired and escapees can go EVERYWHERE and be difficult to find and clean up. I got these to absorb water.  I put them in with a plant I am rooting.  I'm putting them in plant pots to help hold water when we're out of town.  I've made dessicant bags out of them using empty tea bags (they're available without tea). They are slightly larger than a poppy seed and swell to about 5mm diameter (~10X).  They hold a LOT of water.,positive,positive
Melissa & Doug Birthday Party Cake - Wooden Play Food With Mix-n-Match Toppings and 7 Candles,"This is a great product. We bought this along with the Kid Kraft real looking play kitchen and some plastic play food. This is the item my kids (and every single neighbor kid that comes over) gravitates toward. Some kids like the little candy and decoration pieces, some like to serve it up with the pie server, and some like to play with the candles and sing happy birthday to every one in the room. Regardless, it is one of the few toys that doesn't get a rotation of being stored in the closet for a while because it gets played with daily.",positive,positive

Rummikub - Classic Edition - The Original Rummy Tile Game by Pressman,"We have spent hours playing this game.  It is fun and a great way to keep your brain active.  I like how you can arrange tiles to make you spreads.  If you enjoy any type of card game, this one is easy to play and engaging.  A great way to spend with family and friends.  You can change the rules to make it easier to play as well.  My in-laws don't like using the wild cards.  When I play with my sister-in-law, we use the wilds but have a rule that you have to play it in a spread if you can... it keeps the game more ""fair"" and changing!",positive,positive

"Wingspan Board Game - A Bird-Collection, Engine-Building Stonemaier Game for 1-5 Players, Ages 14+","Having played the digital version before, I knew Wingspan is a lot of fun, though I was initially concerned about the price of the physical edition.  I decided to pick up a physical copy though and am very impressed with the package provided, which completely justifies the price tag.  The box is chock full of high quality boards, cards, and game pieces, and even includes a card organization tray and a dice tower, along with a diagram showing how to fit all the parts in the box.  There's also plenty of bags to keep everything in (and the wooden pieces come pre-bagged for you.)  As a bonus this new edition of the game now includes the swift start pack, which used to be a separate item.  It's just a couple extra cards but it's a nice addition. The only issue I had was that the slot cuts on the dice tower to mount the angled ramps were a bit inconsistent.  One is loose and the other is extremely tight, which actually resulted in me partially tearing the surface layer off one of the pieces.  Clearly I shouldn't have tried to force it, but nothing a bit of glue can't fix.",positive,positive
Melissa & Doug Examine and Treat Pet Vet Play Set (24 pcs),"This toy set sparks creativity, imagination and hours of fun.

Love Lingual: Card Game - Better Language for Better Love - 150 Conversation Starter Questions for Couples - to Explore & Deepen Connections with Your Partner - Date Night & Relationship Cards,My partner and I really enjoy this game but we had to tweak it just a bit for us. We made it so that for every question asked you had to give examples or go into detail or in some way make the answer longer. There were quite a few we could answer with one word or one sentence and we felt like that didn't do justice to trying to really understand one another. So we tweaked it a bit. I really recommend this and advise you tweak it to fit you and your s.o. :),positive,positive

I found this out after all the packaging had been discarded, so what can I do............. One other gripe is that the battery compartment on the remote control is held shut by a screw. The screwdriver provided is an M1 philips, while the screw is an M2 philips. It's not that hard for the screw driver to cam out of the screw head and poke the hand that's holding the remote. This could be an injury risk for children that do not yet understand how to use hand tools safely. For the reason above, and for the reason that it's hard to figure out how to charge the thing, I consider this to be a bad gift idea.",negative,negative

Melissa & Doug Slice and Bake Wooden Cookie Play Food Set,"My girls love to pretend cook or bake anything.  When my daughter played with this set at her preschool I knew we had to own it.  I feel like it really helps develop fine motor skills as it allows you to pretend slice the cookies, and decorate with the icings provided.  I'm also happy that the velcro attached is very sturdy and doesn't fray.  The cookies come stacked with their icing stacked on top in a cardboard tube.  The bottom end is capped in tin, and the top end that you open has a removable plastic lid that pops out.  I would recommend  helping your kids if they are young like mine and play rough with their toys as the tin end has already popped off.  I will have to find some time to glue the end on.  The set comes with a baking tray with the corresponding velcro pieces to attach the cookies to.  It also comes with the spatula, a slicing knife and an oven mitt.  The set overall is so cute and my kids love playing with it.  I haven't had one complaint about Melissa and Doug quality, you can't go wrong with this purchase for your little one's bakery.",positive,positive

"Do A Dot Art! Markers 6-Pack Rainbow Washable Paint Markers, The Original Dot Marker",Probably great for older kids and my 2 and 3 year olds LOVED THIS. But they squeeze out too much ink and get it on their arms and both my kids got a rash wherever the ink got on their skin. Wouldn't likely be a problem for an older child than my 2 and 3 year olds who are pretty messy. But that's why I took off stars. They LOVE IT though and ask to do this all the time.  Now I only let them do it right before bath time.,neutral,neutral

Brain Flakes 500 Piece Interlocking Plastic Disc Set - A Creative and Educational Alternative to Building Blocks - Tested for Children's Safety - A Great Stem Toy for Both Boys and Girls,"I was a little leery getting this toy because the price was a little higher than I wanted to spend on something new.  However, I'm really glad that I took the chance because the kids absolutely LOVED it.  I tried them out immediately and at first I thought they might be too hard for the kids, but after a little bit of practice I got the hang of how to connect them rather well.  So, I was able to show the 6 year old and 4 year old how to use them.  They both did pretty well and LOVED taking everything apart.  One of the adults built a space ship and the kids build things that they give names to... but I am not sure what they really were!  They have great imaginations, so this toy is absolutely perfect for them.  I definitely see hours and hours of fun which is better than many toys that are more expensive!",positive,positive

My wife and I play because we can sit at our favorite spots in the living room and just call out grids. We will play a few rounds each time we pull it out. Great game to practice strategy and teach kids with as well. The planes that are included in this new version add a little extra to the gameplay. One small negative is that there is no outlined space to store the planes when the game is not in use but this issue does not merit any stars being taken off of the game.,positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Cutting Fruit Set - Wooden Play Food Kitchen Accessory,"My 3 yr old just loved this fruit cutting set. Learning to hold the items down with one hand and using a tool with the other hand was something she wasn't used to. She cuts the fruit and pretends to cook in one of her little pots, then serves the items on a plate. For a 3 yr old who is just discovering imaginary play, this set is a simple yet perfect toy. The fruit does seem sturdy, but I did notice small dings in the paint after a few rounds of dropping on the floor. Nothing that isn't expected of a toy that belongs to a toddler.",positive,positive

"Barbie Fashionistas Doll #165, with Wheelchair & Long Blonde Hair Wearing Tropical Romper, Orange Shoes & Lemon Fanny Pack, Toy for Kids 3 to 8 Years Old","My 6 year old daughter was recently diagnosed with a rare childhood disease that requires her to be in a wheelchair for the next couple of years, so as soon as I saw this Barbie I knew she had to have it. She and her little sister love playing with dolls together, including Barbie/Chelsea dolls and play sets, so I knew this would be a hit and hopefully help my daughter feel like being in a wheelchair is a little less abnormal. I happened to have painted the frame of her wheelchair pink, so this wheelchair looks very similar to my daughter's which is a bonus. The Barbie doll is typical barbie, but with a little more ability to move the arms/hands/legs than a lot of Barbies have. The wheelchair is really nice quality, better than I expected. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this Barbie option that just so happens to fit in well with a challenging time in my daughter's life.",positive,positive

"Pokémon Assorted Cards, 50 Pieces","I wasn’t expecting a holographic charizard or anything, and I expected a few duplicates but having 5-6 cards each of 3 Pokémon is a bit much. But the silver lining is that all the cards were Pokémon, no energy or trainer cards. I’m sure my 5 year old will still love them, maybe his friends have cards and will trade him some of their duplicates, but I probably wouldn’t buy this again. It came packaged in shrink wrap with the cards exposed, not the normal booster pack packaging",negative,neutral

It's really nice that there are lots of animals and none of them are repeated copies. The size is perfect to use as a cupcake topper. I like that these are mostly realistic looking, however some of the paint jobs could be improved upon (some of it looks a bit messy and other colors aren't the actual color of the animals). Not all of the animals are study on their feet, but I didn't get them for this use. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and the quality of the product.",positive,positive

Everything worked out great, it is definitely a lot for the price, and they had a blast until after two days I noticed my middle son started to develop a rash. This rash is only on his hands and arms where he had the beads up to. After consulting with his doctor to make sure it was not something else, it was determined he had an allergic reaction to these beads as he has not been allergic to anything else before and my other two children and I did not have this rash. I gave one star because they do not tell you exactly what these are made of so the doctor and I could rule what is causing this. I had to go research them a lot further to find an answer when I should be labeled on it.",negative,negative

Play Nine - The Card Game of Golf!,"I was drawn to buying this game after reading the reviews. I wanted to get my kids a board game for Christmas. Maybe if I found a good one, I would convince them to drop the PS for a while. My kids are crazy about golf, so this game was an immediate catcher. They got it for Christmas and that same day we played as a family. My kids are 9, 11 and 14. They all understood the instructions quickly, and started making strategic moves within 2 rounds. One of the things I like the most is the game is easy, challenging and dynamic. Rounds are not so long. You can play 9 rounds (9 holes) or end the game after a few rounds. It’s a really good game. Totally recommend it!",positive,positive

Cards Against Humanity,"In the wide world of party card games where one player has a prompt card and the other players submit response cards, Cards Against Humanity is the one that probably comes to mind first for most people. By no means does that make it the best in its class, however. Most of the amusement from the game is derived from the shock value of what's written on the cards, and as a result the game becomes less amusing after the first play. This also discourages players from choosing response cards that actually synergize with the prompt card -- oftentimes, judges will choose the ""funniest"" response card, regardless of if it makes sense in context or not. For your next game night, choose a game that actually has gameplay value and not a game that relies on ""edginess"" to be fun.",neutral,negative

It looks complicated, but once you start playing with it, it completely explains itself and gets easy. It continues to do more and more stuff as it goes and as you play with it. Make sure you set the time and date so that at night it sleeps when they sleep. I can’t put into words how awesome it is. Gives them something to take care of and play with at the same time! You continue just to play, feed, take outside, take pictures, unlock stuff etc. as it grows and does more. She has been so attentive to it. So glad we got her and her little friends one all for Christmas so they can play together and also, it connects together! We haven’t did that yet.

We took a trip to the zoo the second day we had it so it sucks because my son took pictures of the seals at one point that we really liked. We even tried resetting and reinserting the memory card but nothing. Picture quality isn't full on HD or something, but it is perfect for its purpose and it’s really easy to use.

I like that everyone is involved in every roll of the dice, not just when it is your turn.

"Wingspan Board Game - A Bird-Collection, Engine-Building Stonemaier Game for 1-5 Players, Ages 14+","This is an amazing fun game to play with 1-5 people.  I wanted to get it for my wife because she is an avid birder. At first, she was overwhelmed trying to figure out how to play the game using the instructions that came with the game.  She tossed the papers at me and said, ""You figure this out!""  I fired up YouTube on the smart TV, and we watched a couple of videos on how to play Wingspan.  30 minutes later we were in the middle of first game!  The quality of this board game and it's components is the best.  The only thing that could be slightly improved is the storage for the bird food and eggs.  However, I've already 3D printed a solution from Thingiverse that solves that minor issue.  Even if you're not into birds, you'll still enjoy this game.  It doesn't take long to play a game - about and hour for a game with 5 people.  20-30 minutes for 2 players.  Coming up with different strategies to win is where we are at now with the game!",positive,positive

"Exploding Kittens - A Russian Roulette Card Game, Easy Family-Friendly Party Games - Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids - 2-5 Players","I bought the original version for my grandparents for Christmas because they love cards games and I will say old people won’t understand this game. It was way too weird and confusing for my old people. I’m giving the game 4 stars because the instructions are kind of confusing. We never knew if you were supposed to maintain 5 cards at all times or if it didn’t matter. We didn’t have internet connection to watch the online instructions so we just had the paper instructions which should have been enough, but they weren’t very clear. It also was confusing when my grandmother was out of cards but hadn’t gotten an exploding cat yet (had used her diffuse card as her last card to diffuse the cat) and my grandfather still had cards so he went and got an exploding cat. So does that mean my grandma who didn’t even have cards was the winner? Overall we had a laugh, but there’s was a bit too much left to the imagination for a true card player.",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Decorate-Your-Own Wooden Craft Kits Set - Race Car and Monster Truck,The disclosure on the box is horrible. It says it’s will not come out of some fabrics or wash off and then it says MOST fabrics. Really? It took me half and hour to SCRUB my son’s hands of the paint & had to scrap with my nails the paint off his skin. I would have paid 2-3$ more if they even used washable paint or crayola. Don’t know if we’ll get this next time. Probably never use their paint though. I’m dissatisfied and disappointed in Melissa &Doug. This quality was the pits.,negative,neutral

"Star Wars The Child Animatronic Edition 7.2-Inch-Tall Toy by Hasbro with Over 25 Sound and Motion Combinations, Toys for Kids Ages 4 and Up , Green","The media could not be loaded. Update: I added a section on the bottom of my review covering the disassembly of the animatronic + a photo of my work-in-progress re-sculpting of the face. Note: I bought a “used” version of the product which allowed me to get a better price. The only evidence of this toy being first opened by someone else is the box and packaging - the animatronic arrived clean, all parts and pieces including the necklace. The only worrying part is the fact the animatronic arrived loose in his box - which also tells me something about the durability of this toy, as it was able to bounce around for who knows how long during shipping! The package has small pegs that fit into the toy’s feet; either mine was never put back on, or it came loose during transit. I have not noticed any damage to the animatronic, cosmetically or otherwise, so wooo! —— Yep. Heart lost instantly. I wasn’t expecting the puppet to be in the “try me” configuration, so when I picked him up out of the box the first thing that happened was adorable baby noises and gestures, and then a force-arm-raise. The volume is much louder than I was expecting, in a good way! (I just maybe should have waited until everyone in my household was awake before unboxing 🤣) Flipped the switch from “try me” to “on” and he’s been doing a variety of movements and noises. If I leave him alone for a while (standing), he makes noises for a while, but will eventually go and remain silent until someone nudges him or touches his head. Sometimes just picking him up will trigger a response. I bought this animatronic to use as an acting prop when in Mandalorian armor, for a costuming group I joined. The facial expressions and motion-activated “special moves” are fantastic for that purpose. I will need to make the puppet a little more realistic, both out of personal preference and for acting performance. For those wondering about modding their own, or just in general: The head and eyelids are hard plastic. The ears are a soft rubber/latex/something. It has a little bit of stretch to it which is great for helping prevent tears, and seems a durable enough thickness without being TOO thick and ruining the “ear membrane” effect. I’m glad it means it is far easier to repaint the face and add more details / peach fuzz than I was expecting! It also means the face isn’t gonna fall apart on me over the years right away, since those soft rubber coverings do degrade over time. Ears can be replaced down the road far easier than an entire head sculpt :D The arms are like baby doll arms - just a little flexible hard-rubber give but otherwise hard. The right arm of the puppet does not *automatically* move. It does however have a simple swivel action. — — Bonus: I put the robot down in sleeping mode and he stays quiet; but if I reach over and pet his head gently, he makes sleepy noises and it is ADORABLE. Also, useful, because i can have him in “quiet idle mode” and then cause an acting interaction with hise noise and gestures. Sometimes he’ll move his head in his sleep (when prompted) when he makes noises, without opening his eyes, and it adds a nice touch of realism and variety in the gestures that really brings this puppet to life. All in all.... super happy with my purchase. Technology and art have come such a long way - I never expected to recieve such a quality animatronic piece for such an affordable price. Final note; The robotics do make a little noise, but his sound effects honestly seem to drown all that out. I find it easy to ignore. As others have noted, the Mythosaur skull necklace is not metal - some kind of slightly soft plastic, which makes it a lot safer for some of the younger kids. It also has an adjustable cord which is cool! ____ DISASSEMBLY: **DISCLAIMER: Do so at your own risk. You may break your toy, possibly beyond repair. Take photos of every step so you have a reference for re-assembling the figure when done. There's a lot of little parts to be aware of. Also keep track of which screws go where, just in case. The animatronic was WAY easier to take apart than I was worried, but it did take me time and patience to avoid breaking anything. Four screws on the main body takes the back off. Be careful, because the interior is very delicate wiring and the plastic moving parts have a clear lubricant on them you don't want to muck up or get on your fingers. The non-animated arm comes out easy; the other you need to carefully disconnect from it's little swinging piston (this is the arm that lifts when the force-move is activated), without snapping the delicate plastic parts. This is also where the lubricant is mostly situated. There's plenty of space inside the body, which is perfect for modding purposes - I plan on replacing the voice box with a higher quality one and possibly upgrading its sound files. The head does not come off quite so easily - this is the part I was most worried about breaking during removal. I chose to only undo the bottom two screws (instead of removing the entire top assembly) and gently cracked open the head casing, and removed the back. I removed the ears, which slide right off. Each ones has a small plastic rod inside for animating it - be careful not to stress the joints or bend these. To get the front face off, I had to wiggle it a bit and very carefully extract it from the neck opening, as I didn't remove the entire head assembly itself - be gentle, go slow, take your time, don't be afraid to back off and start over. Cracking the head can be fixed, but may be either more trouble than it's worth, and depending on how bad it is, might make re-assembly difficult if you've made a tiny shift somewhere, and the electronics don't fit snugly anymore. The head has a small metal plate atop it; this is loosely seated, so be careful. If it falls out, use a pliers (or rubber gloves) and carefully tuck it back into place (to avoid oils from your skin getting on the metal; crucial for long-term care of your animatronic). With the head-case and ears removed, I settled the ears back into place, then closed the head up and stuffed it with paper towels for additional support, just in case, as I'll be handling it a lot and applying some pressure for my sculpting. If you're sculpting on the model, modifying it, etc - DO NOT TOUCH THE INSIDES unless you really know what you are doing and have a need to. This means being careful not to accidentally get clay over the edges and gunk up the inside, carve too deep and open up a hole in the head casing, etc; the electronics perfectly fit in the interior of the head, and even a small disturbance could affect the fit later. The eyes are also difficult to remove; they are three parts (well, many more than that, but I removed three pieces of their assembly); the painted eyes (clear plastic with eye decal on the interior, each one is its own piece), the eyelids (green plastic piece; this is one item, with a small bar between the eyelids), and the pin that goes through the holes of everything to secure it all as one unit. The pin has one side with a small ridge on it to prevent it from being pulled all the way through the other way - it must be pulled out in the direction it wants to go. Fiddle with it, take your time, and be very, very careful applying pressure to pull the pin free. I actually ended up scattering the eye pieces all over the floor, because I didn't realize the clear eyes and eyelids weren't glued together. I set the eyes and eyelids aside, and re-inserted the pin back into place in its original orientation for safe-keeping. Photos are your friend when it comes time to re-assemble everything. You can not take too many detail shots.",positive,positive

Tamagotchi Pix - Floral (Pink) (42901),"I like the Tamagotchi Pix. The animations are fluid, there are a ton of games that change daily and the cooking features the camera to find different dishes, which is a lot of fun. I have heard the button sensitivity is inconsistent between devices. Some are more responsive than others. Also, rechargeable batteries are recommended as they go through batteries fast. With that said, I would NOT order this on Amazon. The box was smashed (for a collector the box is important), the faceplate was knocked out of place by being handled so poorly. Also, the screen and front plate were covered in tiny scratches. They offered me $13 as an apology...",negative,positive

The kids didn't really need cookie cutters, but the tops are flat (easier for pressing downward) and it keeps them out of my collection.  Our favorite part is the little mold on the cookie sheet that looks like one of those cream-filled chocolate cookies.  Oreos are my daughter's favorite cookies ;)",positive,positive

This game gives no time to get to know the person better or any time for ""warm up."" Some of the questions would have caused arguments with my partner, so if you do decide to purchase, I would highly suggest going through the cards before you play to take any cards out you may find offensive.

Science STEM Activities - Educational Gifts for Boys & Girls Age 3-5 5-7 8-12 Year Old,"Wow are these eggs messy once the kids start their digging (yes that was expected). would of been better had the eggs come a little softer and easier to dig. Instead we had to soak in water, which then once the kids start digging into the eggs, just turns into mud. Kids had fun but even they didnt really like how hard it was to dig to the dinosaur. We still have eggs leftover which i dont think will ever get used just because its a little more ""work"" than it is fun.",negative,negative

We had an issue out of the box with one of the cars not making sound so I emailed Prextex.  They responded within the hour and within 3 days I had a replacement.  One of the best customer service experiences I've ever had.  We've been playing with these cars for several weeks now.

The audio is surprisingly clear as if listening to a stereo. The sound level however on the one I purchased is very finicky and it is either off or loud, nothing in between.

"Learning Resources Farmer's Market Color Sorting Set - 30 Pieces, Ages 18+ months Pretend Play Toys for Toddlers, Play Food for Toddlers, Play Kitchen for Toddlers","This review is for the Learning Resources Farmers Market Color Sorting Set. I bought this color sorting set for my 3 year old son. He currently is enrolled in the Early Childhood Special Education program. I'm constantly looking for activities that will grab his interest as well as assist him in the various areas he struggles in. This does that. Included in this purchase is a set of 5 plastic baskets which are labeled with a different color on each one. It also comes with 25 pieces of fruit and vegetables- a total of 5 fruits and vegetables  for each color. The baskets are a hard plastic and have withstood many a fling across the room.  They have never cracked and look as new and vibrant as the day I bought them.  The same can be said for the fruit.  They are firm and have the feeling of a rubber and plastic combination. My son has chewed on them and tried to squish them and they're in perfect condition. They are not slippery and have a nice thickness to them (without being too big)which makes it easy to grasp.  They all have a vibrant color to them and have maintained their vibrancy even after heavy usage. These are extremely durable and are very versatile.  We use this for both imaginative and structured play.  They are used in our toy kitchen and on pretend shopping trips.  We use them for color identification, sorting, fruit and vegetable identification and counting.  My son will sit in front of the baskets and sort, and sometimes he'll stand a small distance away and toss the fruit into the baskets.  We'll place the food pieces around the living room and have him run to grab them according to food name or color. I'm very pleased with the quality of the baskets and fruit.

"LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Mario Starter Course 71360 Building Kit, Interactive Set Featuring Mario, Bowser Jr. and Goomba Figures (231 Pieces)","The Lego Super Mario Starter Course comes with the interactive Mario figure, some enemies, interactive blocks, and enough pieces to build plenty of obstacles to create your own Mario levels. The Mario figure interacts with your creation, talking to you and playing music, collecting coins, making faces, etc. It uses bar codes on special blocks to determine if Mario is facing an enemy or special block (like a ? block or flagpole). It recognizes green blocks as grass, red blocks as lava, and blue blocks as water. So you are able to use your own Legos to create your own obstacles, and the Mario figure will recognize them if you have the same color blocks already. You can reconfigure the course any way you want, so the only limit is your imagination. The set requires the Super Mario Lego mobile app on a separate device. It comes with no paper instructions, all of the building instructions are within the app. The Mario figure must connect to the app via Bluetooth, so it requires GPS location services on (which is a problem with my child's Amazon Freetime account). The app allows you to take pictures of your creations, save them to rebuild later, share with others when you sign up for an account, etc. Because the app is required and its features cannot be turned off, I feel the toy is not suitable for young children to use unattended. Perhaps it should be rated 12+ instead.",positive,neutral

Ticket to Ride Board Game | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Train Game | Ages 8+ | For 2 to 5 players | Average Playtime 30-60 minutes | Made by Days of Wonder,"This game is a blast.  Its repeatability is high, among games like Monopoly.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons: 1 - There is only 5 players maximum. The board could accomodate 1 more player. I know that does not seem like a big difference, but in the play and flow of the game, having 1 more player could make this game even tighter and more competetive, forcing players to have more strategy in picking their routes. 2 - The instructons for this game are very long and repetetive, and even somewhat confusing. It all makes sense after you get through a few rounds of turns, but at first the instructions leave players looking for a simpler bullet list of ""how to"". Other than this, the game is near perfection.",positive,positive

I read someone’s review that claimed the batteries only lasted two hours. I don’t know what kind of  batteries she used. Ten days ago I received them and I put new batteries in.  The walkie-talkies have been on 10 days.  I bought them as a toy for my  six-year-old son, but we use them every day.  He likes it when I talk to him on the radio to tell him dinner is ready, or whatever.  I don’t know how long these batteries are going to last but it’s been 10 days and they still have a full charge. He hasn’t had any problems using it. The first thing I did when I received them was put the batteries in, the second thing I did was to lock it.  I haven’t played with any of the features, and I haven’t made any changes to the settings. He’s dropped it more than once and it’s fine. They are shaped to fit the hand comfortably.  There are ridges to help it from slipping out of your hand.  The push to talk button is rubberized nonslip.  Everything is quality. These are not just toys; they don’t look act or feel like toys.",positive,positive

There's not much in the ways of assembly, but the issue is, the parts snap together tight, like too tight. When putting these together, I felt like I was going to break them before anyone had a chance to actually play with them. The ""real"" vacuum action is complete and utter garbage. When I bought these, they were around $40.00 each, I have no idea how in the hell they can justify the price for these things when I can get an actual handheld rechargeable vacuum for the same price. They could have put a little more effort into these and made the vacuum action stronger on it. Over priced.",negative,neutral

Taco vs Burrito - The Wildly Popular Surprisingly Strategic Card Game Created by a 7 Year Old,"Not what I expected.  My son always has a debate about if a soft taco is a burrito or a taco, so I thought this game would be along those lines.  It's not.  the only taco/burrito thing that happens is what you pick to hold your cards, it really has nothing to do with the game.  It is a fun game, easy to learn.

Czech Games Codenames: Duet - The Two Player Word Deduction Game,"Both the original Codenames and Duet have the same fun word association mechanic at their core, but I find Duet much more enjoyable because it takes away the terribly unbalanced oppositional team mechanics and replaces them with cooperative mechanics. The difficulty of a round of Codenames is dependent upon the random layout of words and your objective card. Sometimes you luck out with a bunch of words that are easy to relate and ""death"" words that are easy to avoid. Sometimes you get a devilishly difficult layout where you have to rack your brain just to make a tenuous connection between two words without leading your team astray. This randomness in difficulty makes the oppositional nature of the original Codenames very poorly balanced: sometimes one team has a word layout so easy that makes it almost impossible for them to lose right from the start. Duet eliminates the poor balance problem by putting you and the other player(s) on the same team. This shared fate means no team unfairly benefits from randomness: if one side has an easy layout it helps everyone win the game. The inclusion of more ""death"" words for both sides also makes the core mechanic more difficult and provides some threat of losing even in a co-op game. Due to the random difficulty of rounds I don't find the ""clue limit"" mechanic to be compelling and I no longer play with it. We just to try to finish with as few clues as possible. Even though this game is called Duet and designed for 2 players, it works great with teams. Just have two teams of players on each side instead of 2 individuals. Players on each side can discuss among themselves (with paper or phones to keep quiet if necessary) which clues they want to give. It keeps the game moving along faster to have multiple people thinking of good clues and guessing. It is also works fine to have asymmetric team sizes. Bottom line: one of the best word games around that doesn't suffer from the poorly balanced oppositional gameplay of the original.",positive,positive

"Play-Doh Modeling Compound 24-Pack Case of Colors, Non-Toxic, Multi-Color, 3-Ounce Cans, Ages 2 and up (Amazon Exclusive)","These 3-ounce cans are the perfect size for little ones’ hands. With so many colors, if all three girls want pink at the same time, each one can have some shade of pink, or the 3-oz ball is still big enough to share. We keep our Play-Doh in a large see-through plastic box so that the kids can choose a color without dumping out every can. Keeping the lid on the box after playtime helps to keep the dough moist, just in case any of the can lids aren't on tightly. If the dough gets slightly dried out or too stiff to work, wrap it in a damp paper towel before putting it in the can after play. If the dough is very dry or crumbly, sprinkle some water over the ball of dough  and knead it until soft, pulling in the crumbs and adding more water as necessary. I’ve been able to restore life to some Play-Doh that seemed too far gone to keep. It just takes water, kneading, and patience. You can buy tools to roll, cut, and shape the dough, but because it’s non-toxic the kids and I like to find different kitchen tools to make shapes and patterns. Admittedly, little pieces can end up on the floor, so we put a large plastic tablecloth from the discount store under the play table. It catches the crumbs and makes for easy cleanup.",positive,positive

Tamagotchi Pix - Floral (Pink) (42901),"I love Tamagotchi and I have a wide range of versions. To name a few, I have the originals, the Angelgotchi, the ocean and bug themed ones, all of the Connections, and a lot of the Japanese color-screens such as TMGC+C, iD, iDL, P's, and m!x. I have the On as well. In my opinion, this is a fantastic and engaging version that is sure to hold my attention for a long time. It might not be the absolute best, I'm not sure yet--but it's excellent, and that's what matters. GOOD: - The smooth animations are a welcome upgrade, and the character close-ups are nice and big. - There are a lot of games. The biggest problem with previous color-screen Tamagotchis is that there were very few games. This one has 6 at the arcade, 2 under the play button, and others in other areas of the device. The games are really fun and varied and the arcade only has 2 games at a time, so it's fun to see what games will be available each day. - The room backgrounds on this version are some of the greatest in my opinion. I especially LOVE the broadway background. - There are goals and little things to do each day. Unlocking all the items, trying to cook all the foods, and meeting all the characters... It's going to be fun trying to reach all the goals. And there's a daily lottery, and you can grow fruit by going to your garden each day (instead of having to go to the Farm like on the On). - Photos are a really nice gimmick. Meeting different characters depending on the color detected by the camera, taking photos of two things to make a recipe depending on the colors, and taking photos to get colors for painting items. Oh yeah, customizing the color of accessories and adding furniture to your room are nice features too. - The camera is better than I had expected. The colors on the camera aren't very bright, but it can take pretty decent quality photos for the size, and they look good if it's an outdoor photo. See the photo I attached of my cat on the porch... she doesn't look happy though, lol. FLAWS: - The battery life is pretty bad. It seems to vary a lot. I put in batteries and they died within 24 hours. Then I put in more batteries from the exact same pack and they lasted 5 days. I think it depends heavily on how much the camera function is used. And what do I think of the touch buttons? I was terrible with them at first. But now I have gotten used to them and I find them very comfortable and convenient. When it comes to the A and C buttons, I mostly just touch the general left and right parts of the front plastic instead of touching the circles specifically.",positive,positive

"Gamewright Qwixx - A Fast Family Dice Game Multi-colored, 5""","I absolutely love this game.  I'm the mom in the family, and I am asked to play games constantly.  I favor games that are easy to remember (seriously, we have so many games that I have to review rules on the more complicated ones that we don't play all the time), and this one fits the bill perfectly.  Plus, it's quick, so I can fit in a game with each child and not blow an entire evening.  And, it will be good for travel because it's so compact.  There is certainly a fair amount of luck involved (as with most dice type games), but there is strategy as well.  But that's perfect when you play games with younger children, as then everyone has a fair chance to win.  I don't let my kids win games, so when they win, they know it's fair and square.  Honestly, as of right now, this is one of my all time favorite games.",positive,positive
"PicassoTiles 100 Piece Set 100pcs Magnet Building Tiles Clear Magnetic 3D Building Blocks Construction Playboards, Creativity Beyond Imagination, Inspirational, Recreational, Educational Conventional","We LOVED these tiles at first; they seemed like SUCH a deal compared to the name brand tiles, and the same quality (at first). But after 3 months of daily use, so many of the Picasso brand tiles have cracks in them...while NONE of our Magnet-brand tiles (that we've had for 2 years) have a single crack in them (despite having some scuff marks). The support system within each shape is much less substantial in the Picasso brand...the square tiles only have a simple square border of support within them...while in the MagnetTile brand magnet, the square shape has numerous diagonal supports within the tile to keep it from cracking. Although these tiles do get used DAILY in our house, I am disappointed with how poorly they've held up compared to the (much older) MagnetTiles brand tiles we have.",negative,negative

"TEMI Dinosaur Toy w/ Activity Play Mat & Trees, Educational Realistic Dinosaur Figure Playset to Create a Dino World Including T-Rex, Triceratops, Velociraptor, for Kids, Boys & Girls",The trees don’t stand on the mat that’s included and it’s hard to make some of the dinosaurs stand up.  There are a lot of dinosaurs and they are a good size and appear well made. I’ll see how they hold up with my preschoolers.  The mat does not lay flat so that’s part of the problem with Dino’s and trees not able to stand on it.  The trees are really light and cheaply made.  The kids are 3 years old so their fine motor skills make it hard for them to balance items on mat.,neutral,neutral
35 Pack Handmade Doll Clothes and Accessories Including 5 Wedding Gown Dresses 5 Fashion Dresses 4 Braces Skirt 3 Tops and Pants 3 Bikini Swimsuits 15 Shoes and Bonus 10 Hangers for 11.5 Inch Dolls,"I previously bought from another supplier and the clothes were terrible, but this seller has done a good job. Clothes are well made for the price you pay. Some of the Velcro strips are a bit long so they can use a trim, and each of the dresses have the gap at the back under the Velcro for a doll stand (just stitch it if it shows the barbies rear end). Dresses are a little big for a regular Barbie, but they fit. Shoes are all heels so on a flat footed Barbie they are going to sit at an angle. Pants and tops fit a regular Barbie.

Catan Board Game (Base Game) | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Adventure Board Game | Ages 10+ | for 3 to 4 Players | Average Playtime 60 Minutes | Made by Catan Studio,"My family loves this game! I also purchased the Catan 5-6 Player Extension - 5th Edition, and the Catan Scenarios Helpers of Catan card pack. Together they make endless hours of fun for us and the kids. The game involves strategy, making trade deals, and there are several ways to win. Each of my kids has their own strategy to win and it's fun to see them learning about honesty, shrewd bargaining, and exploring new ways to try to win. Another thing I like about Settlers of Catan is it's more about achieving a personal goal than ""beating"" the other players; the first person to get 10 ""Victory Points"" is the winner. The rules are easy to learn, but mastery of the game takes a long time. This is a great alternative to having the kids play video games or use their ""devices"". Worth every penny, the game pieces are well made and look great. Definitely add this game to your family's game collection!",positive,positive

I disliked the other color reveals because of the hair included factor; hair is already suppose to be on a Barbie's head not included within a package to be added. Bogus!!!  I definitely enjoy the new aspect of prestyled hair which makes maintains the value of the doll because let's be honest once those girls gets their hand of a new beautiful head of hair it's all over.. the doll's hair is matted within a couple months. Prestyled instyle hair can maintained forever and these dolls are definitely indestructible.  Love the included accessories and the marbled color before reveal is super pretty.

Taco vs Burrito - The Wildly Popular Surprisingly Strategic Card Game Created by a 7 Year Old,"This game has all of the potential to be a good game, but it's terribly unbalanced and boring, and the mechanics don't use the theme at all.

"Do A Dot Art! Markers 6-Pack Rainbow Washable Paint Markers, The Original Dot Marker","My daughter has been using these for over a year now. She’s only 2.5, so we started them young! I can’t tell you how many pages of dots (same colors, different colors) we have around the house because they are innumerable! And these markers are still going strong after all that use. Just a quick tip: as they get older (and start to have less liquid inside), squeeze the middle of the marker before you give it to your little one. That will get the ink flowing. Oh, and try to avoid them pressing the marker down for extended periods of time. Speaking from personal experience, this leads to very messy puddles of ink that soak through the pages of most coloring books and construction paper! Overall, I am very satisfied with this markers and will definitely buy another set whenever my original ones die.",positive,positive
Czech Games Codenames,"Such a fun game! HUGE hit up at the cabin -- we had at least 10 other board/card games but we kept coming back to this one. This game features two competing spy agencies, red and blue.  There are 25 cards laid out in 5 rows of 5.  Each team (agency) has a spymaster with a map of the playing field.  It is their job to get their team mate(s) to pick the correct cards by using codenames as hints - BUT they can only use ONE word!  For example:  If the red spymaster wants his team to pick the card ""fly"" he might say ""Bug, 1"" (Bug= codeword and 1=the number of cards that associate with the codeword.)  But be careful!  If the board also says ""swat"" or ""cricket"" your team might pick the wrong card!  If that happens you might give a point to the other team or you could uncover the assassin, if the assassin is found the game is over and the team who found him loses. We had a large group of 10 playing and it was a blast! Everyone loved it :)",positive,positive

Beat That! - The Bonkers Battle of Wacky Challenges [Family Party Game for Kids & Adults],"What a great party game set, really approachable for most people and ages. Plenty of challenges so if some don't work (we had some that some of the older adults couldn't physically do so we skipped those) you can skip them. Rules are pretty straight forward, cards have helpful images to explain the challenges. Game comes with everything you could need except maybe a couple pieces of paper. My only gripe is that the cups included are just orange solo cups. I wish they were a bit more substantial/durable. Great game though! can't wait to use some of these activities as ice breakers for work parties. Most of these challenges (we did about 25 or so with my family so I didn't see all of them but still) seemed perfectly work appropriate/HR safe.",positive,positive

"Hasbro Gaming Candy Land Kingdom Of Sweet Adventures Board Game For Kids Ages 3 & Up (Amazon Exclusive), Red","When looking to buy Candyland for my son I was sad to hear that the newer versions of the game have a spinner rather than cards and that the characters have changed and are overly sexualized. I ended up with this versions and am happy with it. It has cards and while some of the characters are different from what I remember, they are not dressed in lingerie with lollipops over their breasts. My 4 year old lives this game and it's a great introduction into board games. Taking turns, matching colors, following rules, and sometimes losing are all great skills he is acquiring by playing this game.",positive,positive

"ThinkFun Zingo Bingo Award Winning Preschool Game for Pre-Readers and Early Readers Age 4 and Up - One of the Most Popular Board Games for Boys and Girls and their Parents, Amazon Exclusive Version","I love all Zingo games; I now have three of them. I use them with my students with autism, ages 6-8. It is a great language tool. It helps with fine motor skills. Students have to put the pieces back into the slot if no one has the item. They have to use a pincher grip to push it in and there is a little tension so they have to push a little bit. We had to teach them to put them in correctly, but they caught on quick. I am not sure what it is but the act of pushing the game piece in is reinforcing and they love to do it. This is great for my kids who have weakness in their hands. It also helps with motor planning. Students also take turns being the number caller. This allows for independence in game playing. Students learn their numbers, identifyinghow many objects are in a group, addition using pictures, and number words. A lot can be taught with this one little game.",positive,positive
"Crayola Twistables Crayons Coloring Set, Kids Craft Supplies, Gift, 50 Count","So these SOUND like a great idea--crayons that you don't have to unwrap as you go, or use as tiny stubs? Great! However, they don't color as vibrantly as I would prefer, and their flat tip shape right out of the box makes for a poor coloring experience. The tip is too ungainly in ANY size space; I found myself coloring outside of the lines a LOT, because you will get comfortable, and underestimate the width of the crayon. While it is true that in use, a typical crayon winds up with a flat tip anyway, I find that it is easier to maintain a pointy crayon tip for tight line work (as with traditional crayons), than it is to create one with a flat-tipped crayon such as these. Twistable crayons are a great idea; I just wish it had be executed better.",neutral,neutral

But it is just as described, he walks, “roars” if you want to call it that, and lights up along his back and his mouth. He’s walked across our hardwood floors and cement outside.

This game was a big enough hit with all age groups that both ends of the age spectrum requested more rounds on multiple days.  After about 5 long nights the cards are showing some wear, but we kids are pretty competitive playing.",positive,positive
Melissa & Doug Food Groups - 21 Wooden Pieces and 4 Crates,This is such a cute little set. Very durable other than the fact that the paint is rubbing off on every piece after five months of mild use. The included baskets are great for not only organization but learning food groups. They are the perfect size for kids not tiny but not giant. I love that they are all wooden and not cheap plastic put together with smelly glue. They are very smooth and have been sanded and painted nicely. This will be a toy that lasts through multiple kids despite the paint rubbing off.,positive,positive

He can play on the floor in his room to draw pictures and it keeps him occupied and lets him be creative which I love.,positive,positive
Pressman Checkers -- Classic Game With Folding Board and Interlocking Checkers,"For the price I suppose the product is to be expected, but it’s cheaper than I had anticipated. The board is flimsy and barely even sturdy enough to play on. The pieces are cheap lightweight plastic.

Czech Games Codenames,"I bought this game because everyone raved about what a great party game it was.  And I've broken it out at a few parties and... its all right? Every time we played had the same issue.  You set up the cards, and then you have to wait 10 minutes while your two leads try to figure out what all their cards are.  And then there's about 5 minutes of gameplay.  And then you take another 10 minute break while everyone waits on the new leads to figure things out. It's just slow and everyone gets bored fast.",negative,negative
"Kids Washable Face Mask With Adjustable Ear Loops, Cute Designer Mask for Kid (pattern)","The masks are very cute. Cute enough for my 4 year old to want to wear it for an extended period of time. With that being said, the masks could be made better (or QCed). The ear loops on one of the masks came off after a few hours wear (I noticed that it hadn't been glued properly), another mask had a portion of the graphic missing and another mask had the nose strip over to the side and wasn't wearable. Of the masks I ordered 3 were unusable.",neutral,negative

Farmers Market, grocery store, cooking in the play kitchen, throwing play parties, these fruits and veggies get used for everything. The buckets and produce seem to be very high quality and well able to hold up to the usual abuse. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star product for me (and this may not matter to you, I don't know) is that I couldn't find anywhere on the packaging or in the product description what kinds of plastic these toys are made out of. My little one still teethes on her toys, and I try to be selective about the chemicals in the plastics and paints she has access to. Other than that, I love these and will definitely buy more Learning Resources stuff for my kids to play with at home.",positive,positive

These are Vinyl stickers, which I appreciate. And tons of stickers! 5 11x14 sheets of stickers and 5 scenes. The pages are a thick gloss card stock. Since I have a two year boy, I did as others suggested and put in protector sheets so they wouldn’t rip. The pages are big! Legal size. I didn’t want to spend 3 times as much on protectors  as I did the item and 11x14 is big for an airplane. so I just cut mine down to size. Pictures above of what I cut off and what was in the protector sheet. Since the sheets are glossy I’m using the scrap 5 inch pieces with dry erase and crayons as it wipes easily. So far I’m happy with it for the price and will update after our trip!",positive,positive

My toddler wants to stick them together in a ball and throw,  but he loves them at the table too. They are tons of fun for the money. Everyone who sits down is curious and starts playing with them. This is really only enough for one person. We didn't want to spend a lot, but we might buy a few more of them so we don't have to take apart the stuff we make to make more stuff. I found a different storage container. Great for car or plane ride or in a busy box. Would make an awesome present/ stocking stuffer, party gift or secret 🎅 gift. Don't be mislead by packaging.

The product is super cute and educational, teaching healthy eating habits, shapes, colors and songs. As with most VTech and learning frog products, I feel the age range they market towards is always kind of off. The toy can be enjoyed by a toddler just fine, but the educational component would only be useful to a 3-5 year old. So I think older kids can enjoy it too.",positive,positive
STEAM Life Remote Control Dinosaur Toys for Kids 3 4 5 6 7+ Light Up & Realistic Roaring Sound - T rex Dinosaur Toys - Electronic Walking Dinosaur Toys - Dinosaur Robot Toy for Kids Boys Girls (Green),"FYI, forget ever using the remote… the things a piece of crap and will not work.

"Crayola Fine Line Markers Adult Coloring Set, Kids Indoor Activities At Home, Gift, 40 Count","I like that unlike the SuperTips, these have the color listed on the side by name. Like the SuperTips, however, the color shown (in the plastic of the cap and bottom) can be wildly different from what actually comes out of the marker, being either much darker or lighter. Like the fine point, except I've had some major bleed issues. The copper marker was literally dripping. I took the cap off and the tip dripped like a leaky faucet. I drew on scrap paper before using it on my coloring page but it bled terribly on the page still. Went well outside the desired area and blurred surrounding design. Basically just your standard fine tip Crayola markers in adult-geared packaging/marketing, but the trusty white-label markers we're used to have never bled on me like these ones. Pretty good assortment of colors for the 40 chosen, but again it's hard to be sure which marker to use as the cap doesn't match the ink.",positive,neutral

"TEMI Dinosaur Toy w/ Activity Play Mat & Trees, Educational Realistic Dinosaur Figure Playset to Create a Dino World Including T-Rex, Triceratops, Velociraptor, for Kids, Boys & Girls","First impression, the plastic container it came in is sturdy and durable. I placed it next to a box of wipes for size comparison. While it looks bigger in picture reviews, this box was PACKED with content. The dinosaurs are just as good and quality (in looks and weight) as any other dino figurine. My almost 3 yo girl loves dinos but I wanted to get her just one whole starter set instead of individuals, and these were perfect! The mat is a good size, the trees are a nice addition, the dinos are balanced enough stand on their own, and the mat is big enough for multiple kids to play with. Overall, a good quality dino play kit, especially for the price! Also, I ordered this product this morning and received it by 10pm.",positive,positive

Casdon Dyson Cord-Free Vacuum | Interactive Toy Dyson Vacuum For Children Aged 3+ | Includes Working Suction For Realistic Play,"The vacuum looks just like our dyson vacuum and since our toddler loves the adult-sized vacuum, we got this one for him to play with. It's disappointingly fragile and the suction doesn't really do anything. It's still in one piece, but I don't really expect it to last very long since it is made of cheap plastic and all the parts that get assembled together don't fit quite right. The buttons to open the vacuum or where the parts attach stick and will likely be the first to go. It's cute, but only time will tell if it will last the week.",neutral,neutral

The containers I hydrated the beads in nearly overflowed when I put a 1-2 bead layer on the bottom of the containers. I was able to be very liberal with the use of these because there were so many! I still have one unopened box and half of another for next semesters classes. Might get some more in the future for other fun stuff!

But the seller's overall rating was high, and we were ok getting a few duplicates (I figured they could be used to trade with friends) so I ordered these for my son's 7th birthday. We opened them on the big day, only to find NOT ONE Pokemon character card in the batch!  They are nothing but useless energy cards.  We are beyond disappointed.  How ridiculous to not get at least some character chards in a set of Pokemon cards!!  Icing on the cake...they are non-returnable.  Thanks seller, way to be tricky and deceptive.",negative,negative

"Two Way Radios for Adults, Topsung M880 FRS Walkie Talkie Long Range with VOX Belt Clip/Hands Free Walki Talki with Noise Cancelling for Women Kids Camping Hiking Cruise Ship (Orange 2 in 1)",This was an easy to use walkie talkie.  Only just got back from camping and bought 2 sets for the family.  One didn’t want to connect to the rest of the walkies and one was super low in volume.  But the other set worked well.  The range was about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile without a problem.  Hopefully I can get the other set replaced since this was really great.  Battery life is good when you use good batteries 😊 will change star rating once I get the pair replaced with ones that works😊 Revised review😊 Seller reached out and sent a new pair of walkie talkies since one was unable to connect and worked with the other one.  Have not used the new ones yet but I love that this seller reached out even without filling out a return slip.  Super great seller and customer service is 👍🏼 Will buy from this seller again thank you.,positive,positive

It's easy to learn and it's great to take along when we go camping or travel, we play when we want to relax and have a little down time. We go through several sets of cards per year so this was a re-order to replace our worn set. It was cheaper on Amazon that at our local stores and we don't have to go out and get them.

"12 Pack of 7 Dinosaur Toy Figures with Educational Dinosaur Book, Large Plastic Dinosaur Toys Set for Toddlers, Kids, Boys and Girls","My almost four year old grandson is just beginning to enjoy playing with and learning about dinosaurs.  I looked for a set of plastic dinosaurs that he could have fun with and found this great set.  Not only does it have 12 dinosaurs, it has a full-color paperback book and a nice cardboard carrying/storage box that holds the 12 easily. The book is a wonderful add-on in this set compared to others that I found. I have been rewarding him with two items from this set per week for the last 7 weeks.  The first week, he got the book and a dinosaur, then two dinosaurs per week until the last week when he received one dinosaur and the carrying box. It gave us a lot of pleasure over the last two months and allowed us time to look at the book, absorb the information and discuss the “new” dinosaurs over the entire week.  Now that he has the full set, he is over the moon about them and loves playing with them.  For a fairly inexpensive gift, it was a real hit and one that he will continue to enjoy for a long time. The dinosaurs, which are approximately 7 inches tall/long, included in this kit are: Allosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Apotsaurus, Velociraptor, Parasaurolophus, Diplodocus, Monoclonius, Pachycephalosaurus, Spinosaurus, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, and Tryannosaurus (T-Rex).  When I first opened the box, it was so packed that some of the dinosaurs standing on two feet could not quite stand on their own. I was able to tweak the legs back into position and now all stand well by themselves.",positive,positive

I can tell that was a good idea, as it is still attached and not down my tub drain.",positive,positive

Not a deal breaker just a little misleading. Either way very cute and for the price it was worth it. My child however has already eaten one of them since they are made of cardboard, so probably not great for a 2 year old.",neutral,positive

Melissa & Doug Disney Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck Magnetic Dress-Up Wooden Doll Pretend Play Set (40+ pcs),"My 3 year old enjoys playing with this.  Some of the magnets are the size of a dime (the earrings), so they do end up getting lost around the house from time to time.  I was hoping she would play with it a little more than she does, but she likes to stick them on the refrigerator instead of the Minnie figure.  This toy is well made and has not peeled or flaked (we've had it for a few months now).  The box it comes in is wood and serves as a nice storage container when not in use.  It does come with a plastic cover but is not for storage purposes.",positive,positive

If your're not controlling it, the robot still dances and talks to you. The volume can be controlled. The robot voice is clear and easy to understand. The blue on the robot also has a little shimmer to it and my girls LOVED that. :) just an overall fun toy!",positive,positive
"Monopoly Game: Ultimate Banking Edition Board Game, Electronic Banking Unit, Game for Families and Kids Ages 8 and Up (Amazon Exclusive)",This maybe a spoiler... The game is Monopoly so you can't really not like it. This version however did need to grow on us. I bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. We like the fact that there is no money but all disagreements that people are stealing from the bank are avoided. The special play cards aren't really that interesting and most of them give you the same option to  level up your property which makes the game go by really fast.,neutral,neutral

Because they have been opened and used(some anyway), I am not asking for a refund, but I am looking at other Mft’s, for future purchases. RJ Freeman",negative,negative
Disney Princess Dress Up Trunk Deluxe 21 Piece [Amazon Exclusive],"Even though these are just for dressing up ,didn't expect such poor quality stuff from disney. The material used for the dresses is just okay (4 tops and 3 skirts only)and elastic on the waistline of the  skirts is visible. The trunk is made of cardboard, jewellery is made of plastic and the tiara is made out of cloth. Last but not the least, it's ""Overpriced"".....Very disappointed!",negative,negative

I thought it was the batteries and changed them but the phone is dead. It's so sad because the rest of the items were great, especially the lipstick because it looks real even though it's not. The other 3 star reviews said the same but I thought I'd take a chance. My advice is that just be aware the phone is very iffy.",neutral,neutral

They are for play only. We have only used them in and around our large home. I can call the kids when I am in the kitchen and they are outside or from different floors in the house (we have 4). My 3 year old figured it out with a bit of help from her brother, but loves it now. It has several channels so you don't end up hearing other people's chatter. The volume is good (from quiet that I can't hear them if I am outside the room to LOUD). The walkie talkies fit well in the kids hands. Battery life is quite well too. Had them and use them often for almost a year and just recently had to replace the batteries on one. Think it's because my daughter tends to forget to turn hers off. Good purchase.",positive,positive

Robo Alive Junior Baby Shark Battery-Powered Sing and Swim Bath Toy by ZURU - Baby Shark (Yellow),"My son received a little robo alive fish that he loves to play with in the bath so I immediately searched for other options and came across the baby shark. I purchased without looking at the details. This shark is huge and very slow moving because of it. It also floats so doesn't go darting in the water like his fish. Lastly, you can't turn off the baby shark song so be prepared to hear it over and over as long as the shark is in the water. For what it's worth my son likes it :)",positive,neutral

Hasbro Gaming: Battleship Classic Board Game Strategy Game Ages 7 and Up For 2 Players,"I was a little hesitant to buy this for my son, who wanted Battleship, after reading some of the reviews, so I looked first in some second-hand stores. Old Battleship games are not that easy to find, I guess. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Is it as sturdy as the one I had when I was a kid in the 80s? No, but then none of the toys they still have now that we had then are, and I would say this is actually one of the better throwback toys. It's still pretty well-put-together, I thought. And the game is still the game, with no added bells or whistles or ""improvements,"" and that's what's really important.",positive,positive

First off, the price is amazing at just $5! I love how I can rip out any page that I want if I don’t want to bring the whole book. The stickers are easy to remove as my 2 year old is able to do it by himself. I also enjoy how random each page is. One page can be all about flowers and rainbows while the other has animals, funny phrases and the alphabet. I’m now on my second book and wish there were more editions from this company for the same price. All in all, I highly recommend it!",positive,positive

Wild West Deluxe Toy Marshall Cuffs with Key – Western Handcuffs Role Play Toys | Cowboy Sheriff Police Costume for Kids | Two Keys with Safety Release – Maxx Action,"Bought these for my 6 year old son who had broken at least three pairs of dollar plastic ones. Had these a few months, and they are still holding strong. They came with keys, but I put them up since he said he would lose them anyway. There is the safety release on each cuff, so these are kid friendly. However, they are metal... I would say 4+ age recommendation, but really kids decide to stop slinging things around at different ages. Hell, even we adults decide to throw caution to the wind from time to time; However, I don’t recommend getting too crazy with these lest you wish to brake something. Worth the buy if you don’t have a kid who is into risky business... briefs, button ups, and shades aside.",positive,positive

My daughter was super happy when she opened this gift on Christmas day because she adores unicorns. But after we got it started I noticed one of the wheels on its back legs doesn’t work properly, so the unicorn wont move forward straight (it goes in a circle), it wont turn both ways & wont dance properly in Dance mode. You could see that she was confused & disappointed, but it was probably a bigger disappointment for me seeing one of her gifts be a dud. I wanted to love this toy but because of this plus the body feeling quite flimsy, I’m weary of the quality of their products.",negative,negative

The auto broadcast feature is great for tracking my child in the neighborhood. IT often broadcasted what she was saying so I felt she was safe even when I couldn't see her.  The only issue was it seems to not be able to broadcast from the basement of one of the houses down the street.  The battery also seems to die fast, but that may be because we have it on the auto-broadcast feature.",positive,positive

His torso is also upside down, what a waste of money. I already threw the box away so I can't return it. Get it together McFarlane! I ended up taking a razor and cutting off the cowl. Then I heated up the body, took it apart and flipped the torso around, it was pretty easy to take apart. It looks acceptable now, but I shouldn't have had to do that. At least it's not a COMPLETE waste of money now. The second and third pictures are after I ""fixed"" it.",negative,negative

Disney Buzz Lightyear Interactive Talking Action Figure - 12 Inches,"This is such a cool toy!!!! It was exactly as pictured. Some people complained about getting a different version so I was worried that I would get a weird version too but I bought from the Disney store listing and received exactly what I wanted. My son was over the moon when he got the buzz in the actual buzz spaceship box like in the movie (very nice touch). I took off a star because the durability is very poor. My son is three (to be fair, he is very hard on toys), I was expecting somethings to stop working eventually but the wings broke in the first day. He doesn't really care though! It's still buzz lightyear to him, only now his wings don't fold up. If you have a kid who is nice to toys, this probably won't break for a while. But if you have a kid who is worthy of being in the caterpillar room, you might not like how easily this toy breaks.",positive,positive

"Pressman Mancala - Real Wood Folding Set, with Multicolor Stones by Pressman","Honestly, not sure why this particular model of Mancala has such great reviews. I learned to play Mancala in 4th grade and have loved the game ever since. In middle school I purchased my own game and loved playing it with friends. That game lasted me up until now(16 years) when my own kids dropped it and the hinge that holds the two parts together came off. So I decided to order what I thought would be a “higher quality” board. The FIRST time I received it, the board was in a bit of a rough shape, the finish is a bit rough. Like someone quickly sanded it and without dusting it off put a clear coat on top of it. Also, the board would not lay flat, the wooden hinges keep it from folding out completely. I thought, ah for the price it’s fine....until  I noticed one of the marbles was broken(yes I received the glass ones). So I decided it had to go back. Received the replacement the next day, the board still seems to be in the same shape. Doesn’t flat and still has a rough texture is some placed, but hey the marbles are whole and we can play!",neutral,neutral

Her and my son have had a great time with these toys.  Though this is not the most attractive looking cash register on the market, it works WELL.  It comes with a credit card and with fake money that look real.  The door opens nicely when the Open button is pushed.  The cash register calculator works.  My son, who is 6, enjoys using the calculator to play with for numbers.  He'll often add large numbers together just to see the results when they playing shopping together. It also came with a pad of paper which my children went through in about two days.  Not sure why they included the pad of paper which was mostly useless. Either way, this toy has been a pleasure for me.  The children play with it gently too, which is a rarity for toys in our house.",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Birthday Party Cake - Wooden Play Food With Mix-n-Match Toppings and 7 Candles,"Was super excited to give this to my daughter for her birthday. The packaging and everything was super cute, the ones I started really looking at the pieces I noticed a lot of excess glue, as well as one piece that had dried glue and velcro fuzz on the top and sides. The blue serving tray for the cake has a chip in the middle upon opening. My daughter's daycare (my workplace) has this same toy, so I'm familiar with it and she was excited to see it at home. I understand that it is a kids toy and it's going to get a little chipped up, but I didn't expect it to come chipped in a brand new container. Slightly disappointed.",neutral,neutral

Melissa & Doug 20 Wooden Animal Magnets in a Box,We got these for my baby as a gift.. she's a busy 1 year old and we did give them to her despite the fact that there is an age limit on the box...she loves them. We have taken away the smaller animals from her so she doesn't try to chew or choke on them but she constantly is going to the fridge to talk to the animals and carry the zebra and giraffe around. She even is figuring out what else they can stick too. The magnet covers the entire back of the animal and the colors are bright and nice. Great quality and the sizes range from small (2 quarters side by side) to large (size of your palm). Great diversity in animal too. I have a feeling I'll be seeing these on my fridge for years to come!,positive,positive

LOL. I knew better. Don't give them things that are meant to be thrown across the room if you don't like things being thrown across the room. This was a hit, but might not be suitable for a crowded space or a home with a lot of knick-knacks and expensive collections on display.  Our family gets bigger, but the house doesn't.

Taco vs Burrito - The Wildly Popular Surprisingly Strategic Card Game Created by a 7 Year Old,"My granddaughters aged 5 and 8 love this game! The best thing about it is the adults have as much fun as the kids. The ""No Bueno"" cards are similar to the ""Nope"" cards in Exploding Kittens but the other action cards are original and perhaps even more fun. It is super-quick to learn and kids don't really have to read to play; it only takes them one round to know what all the cards do. My 5 year old beat the pants off us and we were hysterical with all the twists and turns. My only complaint is that I wish more could play, especially as $19.95 is a lot for a card game. When you have a game all ages can play, you need 6-8 people to be able to join in. We'll simply buy a second. Hopefully it goes on lightening deal again soon.",positive,positive

"LEGO Flower Bouquet 10280 Building Kit; A Unique Flower Bouquet and Creative Project for Adults, New 2021 (756 Pieces)","I don't remember the last time I saw something that married the words ""adult"" and ""nerd"" so gorgeously! I ordered these the day they were made available (just good dumb luck that I was searching up Lego sets on New Years Day) and ordered them immediately. Now that I've put them all together they're just as beautiful as the pictures, and I couldn't be happier. Took three hours or so to get them all together and arranged as you see in the pictures. If you've put any Lego sets together in the past, the quality of the individual pieces and the directions will be just what you'd expect: as close to perfect as makes no difference. Everything is sturdy, the colors are vibrant, and they put wonderful thought into every stage of assembly. They even have you weigh down the bottom of the stems so that they aren't too top heavy! The only difficulty is that they're harder to arrange than actual flowers since legos don't bend like real petals, so once you get everything set the way you want you won't want to move the vase too much, but that's to be expected. I really hope they put together other affordable sets like these that I can display around the house. I still can't get over the value for the price compared to their other sets :-) One thing to note: I'm not sure whether to consider this is a lazily recycled resource or an Easter egg, but Zoom in on those mid-length leaves on the roses. They're pterodactyl wings.",positive,positive
Fisher-Price Disney Frozen Elsa & Friends by Little People,"My daughter has not stopped playing with these since she got them a few days ago. Like most little girls she absolutely loves anything Frozen related.

They are pretty durable and not cheap by any means. The painting on them is very well done.",positive,positive

Battat – Farmers Market Basket – Toy Kitchen Accessories – Pretend Cutting Play Food Set for Toddlers 3 Years + (37-Pcs),"Very impressed with this set. I’ve never purchased Battat brand toys before but now I’m a return customer for sure.

Would I have preferred an all wooden set of beautifully painted play food? Yes, BUT they are really pricy.

"Crayola Ultra Clean Washable Markers, Broad Line Markers, Gifts, 40 Classic Colors","Overall, these markers have turned out to be a pretty good deal.  I purchased them for my 5 yr old daughter who loves to draw and color - and, at times, she is pretty hard on them.  Now pushing 4 months of regular use, when I sit down to color with her, I have yet to find a single marker that shows any wear on the tip, nor a single marker that is fully spent or dried out.  That's pretty good in my opinion; when I was a kid, I remember markers were delicate, the tips frayed easily, and their color output was on a noticeable decline after using them just a couple of times.  That is certainly not the case here - indeed, given the price and knowing they were going to be subjected to a fair amount of punishment, I bought them with the assumption I'd need to get another set after 2-3 months - but, they're all still going pretty strong though... The drawbacks are few and fairly minor.  The first is that the box is not designed for functionality with the average consumer in mind.  They're not necessarily bulk, but the packaging makes me think they are intended for a small classroom perhaps.  So when I opened the box, it was just four smaller boxes not built to display all colors for an individual's ease, but maybe to be spread out for a group.  So I had to alter the smaller boxes so the colors could be kept in the larger box, and set so that all colors could be seen at once - i.e., they had to be stair stacked and each box needed cut down...a bit of a hassle. The other drawback is the amount of force required to put the cap back on - you have to leverage sufficient force where a kid using both hands could get close enough to the cap where there's a small pinch point.  It's not anything that would cause an injury, just enough where you're likely to feel an annoying sting from putting the cap on and maybe by accident 1-2x a month. The drawbacks are nitpicks really though.  Overall, this set is a very good value - a wide range of colors, water-based and non-staining, durable, and long-lasting.  I will order these again...I always intended to, it just turns out I didn't need to nearly as soon as I expected I would have to order them again.",positive,positive

Made By Me Create Your Own Window Art - Paint Your Own Suncatchers - DIY Suncatchers - Arts and Craft Kits for Kids Ages 6 and Up,"This is rather hard for kids to do - each window art is a small area to work on and its very hard to stay within the lines with the paint, which comes out thick. My almost 5 year old was frustrated. I also found it hard to stay inside the lines. We used toothpicks to move the paint in the tiny areas. These look cute when finished, and my son liked it, but I wish it was easier to do.",neutral,negative
Giraffe - Slap Bracelets For Kids - Snap Bracelet Party Favors (50-Pack),Bought these for a classroom prize box. I like that there are different designs to appeal to boys and girls. They just don’t hold up though. The appeal of a slap bracelet is the ability to slap it on your wrist repeatedly. After about a day the plastic starts to break near the seam. At that point you are left with a thin piece of metal. Not durable and possibly unsafe once the plastic comes off.,negative,negative

The most tip-top stupid amount of tiny. I feel like they made these containers just to trick amazon buyers into thinking that these would be flippin' normal sized play-dough jars. I am upset about this purchase! So there! I give you a 1 star review! But there's so many of them and I don't feel like returning them so I guess my niece and nephew can just make teeny tiny little creations with their teeny tiny little hands. Does it work like that? Whatever. I want my normal sized play-dough, you guys. Come on now.",negative,negative

"12 Pack of 7 Dinosaur Toy Figures with Educational Dinosaur Book, Large Plastic Dinosaur Toys Set for Toddlers, Kids, Boys and Girls","Not a one of these is 7 inches long, and the quality is poor for $1/dinosaur. Mine are not one solid piece, they are 2 pieces with a very noticeable ""seam"" where they come together, with glue over the seam. Get a different brand, or better yet, get the ones that are $1.50 each at Wal-Mart. Larger, better quality, and one solid piece, so no glue-covered seams!",negative,negative

My 3 year old granddaughter loves pocketbooks and all kinds of girly things, so I purchased this for her for Christmas.  I was really amazed at how innovative and interactive this set is.  The little ""powder"" compact is filled with a foam/sponge looking ""powder"" and a powder puff (in case you're worried about it making a mess - it won't!). The keys have buttons that are interactive as well.  I am very pleased with my purchase.",positive,positive
Hasbro Game of Life Junior,"Sort of lame. We don't want to play the game if that says anything. It's not like the original life game. My son can't read the cards so unless your five year old can read then you need to read the cards for them. Which sort of ruins the game. Cards involve acting out and guessing what the action is, like pictionary. But my kid can't read. So I don't guess because I read the card for him.",negative,neutral

These are made with a cheap thin plastic.,negative,negative

LEGO Star Wars Mandalorian Starfighter 75316 Awesome Toy Building Kit for Kids Featuring 3 Minifigures; New 2021 (544 Pieces),"Even though this isn't technically a set from the Mandalorian Season 2 show, it definitely fits the bill with the Bo Katan Minifigure. Let me get the ship out of the way - It's cool and does some fun twirly things so you change the way it looks. Now the good stuff - the Minifigures are the main reason we purchased this set and they are great. Bo Katan's helmet is detailed nicely and the set comes with a hairpiece to mimic her Clone Wars look. Gar Saxon detail is also great and has unique horn features. Each of the Minifigures comes with a jetpack that I'm assuming will be the same one in the forge set coming out next month so you can get a head start and use the jetpack on Mando. Great set and highly recommend!",positive,positive
"Funko POP Five Nights at Freddy's Articulated Bonnie Action Figure, 5""","My son loves Bonnie. My only issue with it is that the figure comes apart too easily.

Better quality than the Funko FNAF figures I’ve been buying from Walmart. Happy with this purchase overall.",positive,positive
Robo Alive Junior Baby Shark Battery-Powered Sing and Swim Bath Toy by ZURU - Baby Shark (Yellow),"I bought this for my two year old for his birthday in hope of being the best mom ever.  Does he love it?  Oh yes.  He was very excited.  It's cute, good quality and works straight out of the packaging and into the bathtub.  The big problem with this is that it is a constant loop of baby shark and there is no off switch.  The reviews warned me of this and I brushed them off, but after 10 minutes of baby shark on a loop, he had to be removed from the tub.  I wish there was a way that the toy could still swim around but the song could be turned off.  All in all, you are getting exactly what it says, but be warned.  I also wouldn't suggest giving this as a gift unless you have a VERY good or joking relationship with the parents.",neutral,positive

Casdon Dyson Ball | Miniature Dyson Ball Replica For Children Aged 3+ | Features Working Suction To Add Excitement To Playtime,"Exactly what I was hoping it would be. My 18m old loves to help me around the house, so this is perfect for him to vacuum while I am using my own vacuum. The buttons are very easy to use, he figured out the sound/spinner one immediately, and loves to turn it on. The actual suction button is on the back and he doesn't know its there, which makes it good for older children, which will allow him to grow into the vacuum and enjoy it for years to come. It does actually collect small items with the suction and is easy to empty. We were able to collect a leaf, some dog hair, and a little piece of plastic. It does have a way to allow it to stand up on its own, with a ""locking"" foot, that is very convenient and easy to use. Also assembly was a breeze, only had to click in the handle to the rest of the vacuum. Only thing I don't care for is that it does take 4 C batteries, but I bought rechargeable ones for it.",positive,positive

Taco vs Burrito - The Wildly Popular Surprisingly Strategic Card Game Created by a 7 Year Old,"I bought this game as a gift for my 8 year old daughter who loves games.  I was expecting lots of gross foods--but I was surprised at the inappropriate cards--eyeball, human burger, blood salsa, and fresh brains.  Those are not foods that typical people find in their refrigerators.  We do not practice cannibalism.  She was very upset when I suggested that we just take out those cards.  I seriously wonder who thinks that those cards are appropriate for kids.  The rest of the game is funny, but I wish I would have looked through the cards before I gave it to her.",neutral,negative

What a hit! He received all kinds of trucks, toys, books and everything else he loves, but once he opened this, he didn't even care if he opened the rest of his presents. He was using it in minutes and his parent's cell phones are now receiving a well earned rest.

So far my Mango pencil is crumbs no matter how many times I sharpen and by the looks of the bottom end it seems the entire color is crumbs. I have not used every pencil yet but have sharpened a few, the ones that arrived broken (besides Mango) sharpened well and the few we colored down until sharpening was needed. Wish I would've read reviews before purchasing instead of just thinking they were great because of the 4.8 star rating because apparently others have received crumbly pencils as well.",negative,neutral
Casdon Dyson Ball | Miniature Dyson Ball Replica For Children Aged 3+ | Features Working Suction To Add Excitement To Playtime,"Gave this to my 2 yr old granddaughter for Christmas, and it is her 2nd favorite gift (the first was a soft bodied doll, sorry). Her mom says she has been ""vacuuming"" 5 times a day ever since. I cannot comment on durability, because it hasn't been long enough, but it's been used everyday for over a month and hasn't broken yet, and all the functionality is the same so far. And why on earth is ""Suction Power"" something we are asked to rate? Seriously?? It's a TOY, people!  There is a TINY bit of suction power, yes, but that is it. It is NOT meant to clean your floors for real and anyone who buys it for that reason deserves to be disappointed.",positive,positive

She takes this thing everywhere! We ended up having to buy a new one because she loves it so much she took it outside and it got snowed on lol the older kids love it too! This is a super neat little drawing pad and I highly recommend it for all kids that love to doodle. I especially love that it comes with a “leash” to attach the pen to the tablet so it doesn’t get lost. Battery seems to last quite a while on it too which is an added bonus.,positive,positive
"Star Wars The Child Animatronic Edition 7.2-Inch-Tall Toy by Hasbro with Over 25 Sound and Motion Combinations, Toys for Kids Ages 4 and Up , Green","Such a cute little thing!  The animatronics are pretty basic but surprisingly believable for the price and his head and ears are nice and soft/pliable.  Probably wouldn’t make a good bedtime lovie, and time will tell how it holds up once it’s unwrapped for Christmas.  It really only does a handful of different head, face, and hand gestures, as well as some cute sound effects; I think they took some creative liberty when the counting the “unique” things it can do but no real complaints so far!",positive,positive
LEGO Classic Creative Suitcase 10713 Building Kit (213 Pieces),"Purchased for my 4 year old at Christmas.  He loves to remove the Legos from the case and strategically place them throughout the house so that I can experience life in constant agony.

The only safe space I have left is the desk from which I write this tale of terror.",positive,positive

Melissa & Doug Magnetic Human Body Anatomy Play Set With 24 Magnetic Pieces and Storage Tray,"I got this gift for my five year old grandson. He has shown an interest in animal anatomy I.e. the digestive system. This play set is perfect. It helps him see how things are arranged in the body, the systems (he really loves the blood vessels) and yet it is simple enough for a 5 year old. He enjoys telling me the things he has learned. I appreciate the anatomically correct figure; he knows the boy/girl difference, and it is no big deal, whereas missing parts could cause concern. The figure is sturdy, and the magnets hold well. I recommend it.",positive,positive
Fisher-Price Disney Frozen Elsa & Friends by Little People,"I bought this for my daughter and all the pictures showed 4 DIFFERENT figures- Elsa, Anna, Olaf, and kristoff.

35 Pack Handmade Doll Clothes and Accessories Including 5 Wedding Gown Dresses 5 Fashion Dresses 4 Braces Skirt 3 Tops and Pants 3 Bikini Swimsuits 15 Shoes and Bonus 10 Hangers for 11.5 Inch Dolls,"Edited 10/28:  The seller contacted me and has apologized for not contacting me in a timely manner. They are also sending a free replacement, even though I did return the items. I very much appreciate this and think it does go to show they are trying to provide a good customer experience and product. I think it's worth giving them a chance, though I definitely would contact them if there is a problem with the product. Original Review: Avoid this seller! I purchased two of their Barbie-sized clothing packages and am returning them. There were omitted items, particularly the bathing suits. The shoes DO NOT fit! The clothing is pretty, but is too tight in some areas and falling off in others. There were duplicate items in each package and they were the same duplicate items! So, I ended up with multiple identical outfits. The shorts had one leg longer than the other, one cut like a bathing suit, the other mid-thigh. The casual dresses were horrible. Terrible material, stiff like thin cardboard. I purchased these two bundles for my granddaughter's Christmas present and it's going back. Though they encourage you to contact them directly if there are problems, they never responded to my 2 emails. I do not recommend this product!",negative,positive

Melissa & Doug Scoop and Stack Ice Cream Cone Magnetic Pretend Play Set,My kids have not stopped playing with this ice cream set since it arrived this morning! I know people are complaining about the magnets but In my opinion I think they are fine. I feel like they would be super hard to pull apart and then people would complain about that too. I think the magnets are the way they are so that it makes it easy to lift them with the ice cream scoop and so that the ice cream will fall onto the cone once they press the scooper release button. As far is the ice creams falling off the cone....If you have only one scoop of ice cream on the cone you can hold it upside down and the ice cream wont fall off at all (see my images) . It's only when you have more than one scoop that they fall because the more scoops you have the heavier it is obviously.  I think this is a great toy and sparks a lot of imagination!,positive,positive
Hygge Games ...I should have known that! Trivia Game Green,I thought this trivia game would be more than just a deck of typed questions and answers. What a rip off!

"Kids Stickers 1000+, 40 Different Sheets, 3D Puffy Stickers for Kids, Bulk Stickers for Girl Boy Birthday Gift, Scrapbooking, Teachers, Toddlers, Including Animals, Stars, Fishes, Hearts and More","This is a great selection of stickers with lots of variety. Mine came with animals, dinosaurs, vehicles, hearts, stars, food, music, smileys, hobbies, sea life, pets, letters, and numbers. I think I only got 1 or 2 exact duplicate sheets in the entire set (i.e., there were quite a few sheets of stars but each was unique). Some of them are slightly off center prints, like a lopsided smiley but there are so many stickers at such a great price, I can't complain about a few duds. My toddler loves them just the same. They stick well but also come off easily.  The puffiness makes them easier for little fingers to peel off without help. If you want a fun little sticker book to put them in, look up photo albums for Instax cameras. You can stick and peel stickers on the entire album or put favorite stickers in the little photo pockets.",positive,positive

Pressman Checkers -- Classic Game With Folding Board and Interlocking Checkers,"I was a little disappointed when these arrived today. I bought them for my daughter, who commented on how small they were. I am in total agreement. These are definitely NOT the ""large"" , solid hardwood dominoes  that was advertised. They felt more plastic than anything, and were a lot smaller than expected. Listen to the reviews on this one folks. Not worth it. The paint job on these were terrible, and nothing like the original Dominoes that I grew up playing with.",negative,neutral

"Star Wars The Child Animatronic Edition 7.2-Inch-Tall Toy by Hasbro with Over 25 Sound and Motion Combinations, Toys for Kids Ages 4 and Up , Green","I bought The Child as a gift for my wife. She said she wanted me to give her a child, so, yeah, that’s exactly what I did. It took only nine hours instead of the nine months required for a human child, when the stork arrived disguised as an Amazon delivery driver. The Child didn’t arrive wrapped in a blanket like I expected, but in a box, which I originally thought was pretty cruel, but it wasn’t long before I understood. Just minutes after being released from his prison, he began to giggle. Then my wife started to giggle too. I told them both to keep it down, as I was trying to work. The brat blew a raspberry in my general direction, which set my wife to giggling again. I threatened The Child with bodily harm, and said some thing I won’t repeat here, but don’t regret. He did that thing with his hands and I flew across the room. This is when my wife snapped, giggling uncontrollably. She has been playing with him, talking to him (baby talk, of coarse), and quickly going mad. She already has plans to make him a mask so he can leave the house, a Santa hat, a hat and scarf, sun glasses, a crib, and a high chair. He has only been with us for 2 hours. God help us all.",negative,positive

"Obuby Toys for 3-12 Year Old Boys Walkie Talkies for Kids 22 Channels 2 Way Radio Gifts Toys with Backlit LCD Flashlight 3 KMs Range Gift Toys for Age 3 up Boy and Girls to Outside , Hiking, Camping","These are nice. We bought these for a hiking adventure for my kids to play with. They loved them. The sound quality is good we have three kids so having three walkie talkies was a good number for us. The sound quality is good, if they get too close they do have some feedback sometimes but that's to be expected. Once we got home I can clip a walkie talkies to my son, and let him ride his bike around the neighborhood. And let him know when it's time to come home. Downsides. I wish that they put a screw in the battery compartment. My kids can take the batteries out fairly easily and for small kids, we'll just pop those batteries out and lose the batteries in the yard. 🤷‍♀️ Overall they're pretty good.",positive,positive

It was a hit at the party, all the kids were excited to play with it. It only got about 4 times being used before it started to freeze after each picture taken.

Czech Games Codenames: Duet - The Two Player Word Deduction Game,"We played codenames in a group of 4 at Christmas. My 11 year old wasn’t there.

It’s a great toy, with all the neat features and sounds that kids love. However the toy we got was broken right out of the package. His wings come out but only 1 goes back in. I would have returned it but my 4 year old objected. He’d rather keep it as is then have to give it up and separate Buzz from the rest of the Toy Story gang.",negative,positive

We have had this for about 4 months now and it has held up well with being used almost everyday and being dropped several times. Overall, I highly recommend this toy Dyson vacuum!",positive,positive

These offer a great selection of colors and hold up well (as long as your kids don't get to them!).  As a mom, it's always a good idea to purposefully take time to relax, color, and zone out with a great cup of coffee of your favorite drink. Cheers moms (or dads, or whoever)! I rate these a 5/5!

Taco vs Burrito - The Wildly Popular Surprisingly Strategic Card Game Created by a 7 Year Old,"Way to many action cards, not enough ingredient cards, so gameplay is very poor and frustrating, they sell an expansion pack but it seems like they should have included it, or they took cards out and decided to gouge u by trying to sell the complete game in 2 different purchases. definitely a fun game idea but without the expansion pack it doesn't have enough ingredient cards for proper gameplay.",negative,negative

She has the the uncanny ability to instantly disappear in them. I've walked for many miles over the years in a desperate hope of locating her.(Cell PH. don't work kept in her purse she doesn't hear it)(she claims) She does hear this W.T. Now when I am ready to leave  using the Topsung m880 W.T. I order ""lets go""  well ---- that don't exactly work BUT she tells me where to go and gives me a ballpark figure when she maybe ready to leave. It works great inside the stores. I live one half mile from a Walmart store. As a test from Walmart front door I called my wife at home. Wow! she heard me very clear. This W.T is terrific! Guys if you are in my situation and for twenty bucks you can't go wrong with this W.T. I only have one negative comment. l Like someone else mention, the instructions  are hard to read. It's the print. So tiny you will need a strong magnifying glass to read it.Even then hard to read. Given that I still give the Topsung  m880 five stars . Also kind of fun, and you sure can't beat the price!.",positive,positive
Sorry! Game,There is nothing to dislike about sorry.  I bought this game for my older granddaughter who is 9.  With all the technology these days it’s great to have family game night and unplug. We have made it a tradition in our home for years and this helps kids learn about playing fairly and it’s ok to lose sometimes.  No you don’t get a participation trophy in real life and teaching kids basic skills of how to play fairly and winning or loosing in a game is ok and important.,positive,positive
LEGO Creator 3in1 Sports Car Toy 31100 Building Kit (134 Pieces),"I have a little boy who loves lego set, from the moment he opens one he quickly grabs the instructions and starts to build, it does not matter how small the pieces are, or that he does not speaks english at all, the instructions are so easy to understand that he can do it by himself. I'm trying to push him to build his own inventions and usually after building the set he starts to play with them as a toy and stop building, so these 3-1 sets are perfect for both of us, he loves to build and rebuild them and I get to see him using his imagination to mix the set as he wants, the fun never ends.",positive,positive

I would say worth the buy just to see their smiles and some of the random pictures they take throughout the day.,positive,positive
Hanes Men's Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt Value Pack (4-pack),"I bought these crew neck, black t-shirts from Hanes for my son to wear with his Under Armour gym shorts, to work out in and also to hang out in: maybe go to a movie...The Under Armour shorts are really nice. But, sadly, and to my disappointment, there was no way he was wearing them anywhere except under sweatshirts and hoodies. They are so thin they are see through. The collar stretched out after a couple of washes, so he couldn't wear them under the right button down. The hem on the sleeves and at the waist was crooked and the seams were poorly sewn. No joke, it's that bad. I've always gotten Hanes for my boys but we're going with Jockey now, or something else...I hate to even think of him wearing those t-shirts at all, even under his hoodies. I want him to toss them. Forget even giving them to Goodwill or Jesus's House, that would be terrible. However, one redeeming factor, they were delivered pronto via Prime...",negative,negative

The sound it makes was a scary for him, so we took the batteries out until he’s a little older. It doesn’t have any suction at all that we can feel, which we were actually glad about.

"Crayola My First Safety Scissors, Toddler Art Supplies, 3ct","AWFUL, simply awful. I can barely cut paper with these, so there’s no way my 3 year old will be able to. I thought the idea behind these was great, but they really don’t do anything other than scrunch the paper between the “blades”. You’re better off getting a regular pair of blunt children’s scissors and supervising your children while they use them.",negative,negative

The items are not as quality as the ones we purchased under the Barbie logo back in the 50's and 60's, but what is as quality as things were made then? But for the price these items are a very good value, especially to a younger child who might not be paying as much attention to detail. Detail-for example, some dresses were ""pinked"" at the hemline, instead of ""hemmed"". They were still cute on and my little one never commented...nor did I! ;>D",positive,positive

Catan Board Game (Base Game) | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Adventure Board Game | Ages 10+ | for 3 to 4 Players | Average Playtime 60 Minutes | Made by Catan Studio,"I played Catan with friends and love it 5 stars worth. I found a game as a wherehouse deal for about 30% discount. The cardboard game pieces were still in their cardboard frames, so I assumed all were there. Today was the first I actually played it on Zoom and the game appears to be a mishmash of parts from the basic game and an extension. The instructions are from an extension game so I could never play this game with friends at home unless we all knew the game well. I cobbled together the missing tiles by writing on the back of the extra tiles and corrected the extension markers with pen to match the original game markers. I am outside the return window so I can't get an exchange. I'm very disappointed.",negative,neutral
Czech Games Codenames,"This is a great party game. The concept is you form teams, and the team leader gives out one word clues to help their team guess which words belong to the team. Guessing wrong could give points to the other team, could be benign and simply end the turn, or could be disastrous and end the game. Discussions about which words to choose can be side-splittingly funny, so it's hard to keep a poker face as a team lead. The number of clue and word cards are generous so you can play this over and over. In addtion, Clue cards can be used 4 different ways and word cards are double sided. Game play is fast paced, you can easily get through a round in 15 minutes if you used the enclosed timer to keep guesses moving. This game was an instant hit for our family.",positive,positive

"Crayola Ultra Clean Washable Markers, Broad Line Markers, Gifts, 40 Classic Colors","The 8-year-old and I were at my mom's (the 8-y-o's great grandmother), finishing her homework. 8-y-o says, it's too bad Granny doesn't have crayons; she would color a nice picture for her. Wait right there, I said, and headed off to raid my bag of tricks. I returned with this box of markers; the 8-y-o's eyes lit up when she saw it was the BIG box. Then she set to coloring, and all was right with the world. I bought these because the 8-y-o is always getting in trouble with her mom for getting marker marks on her clothes. (I totally get  this; those marks aren't easy to remove.) I haven't tested the washable thing yet, but I have another box, so when I try it out, I'll update this review. For now, though, that they're awesome to the 8-y-o is plenty good enough for me.",positive,positive

The play lipstick broke within a week. The hair brush is the only thing that seems to be decently made. All together, these toys are with about $5, not the 30 they charged.",negative,negative

We play it all the time.  There are four of us (myself, my 11 year old, my 9 year old and my 8 year old)  we all love this game.  Now just for some background, I taught my kids a few years ago how to play rummy 500 so they had a solid knowledge of what to expect.  ...but this is BETTER than Rummy 500!

Fisher-Price See ‘n Say the Farmer Says [Amazon Exclusive],"My husband's nostalgia had to have this. It seemed the best of the options online and probably is. It is small like other reviewers mention but I think it's the perfect size for little hands. Our 14 month old still can't pull the handle down and it shoots up so fast after being pulled, it could potentially be an injury concern. If you don't pull it all the way down, it won't work. There is something rattling on the inside of it as if something broke off. Also, some of the animal sounds are ridiculous, like the mouse & the bunny. Our daughter does enjoy the song options, she's still too young for the quizzes but it'll grow with her. Overall, I'm tempted to donate it but will keep it around for my husband's sake.",positive,negative

Play-Doh Party Pack 10 1oz Cans of Assorted Color,"This was a gift for a friend's 4-year old son. He has several Play Doh sets where you can make play doh burgers, spaghetti and other shapes. So I knew that he loves playing with Play Doh. These are very small mini containers. They will not last long if the kids are pretty active with playing with them a lot due to the small size of each color that you get. They will probably dry out a little faster as well. The kids love the variety of colors in this pack. Who doesn't love fresh Play Doh? It's a fun little gift to bring with you and it gives the kids something to play with while the adults visit!",positive,positive

It's pretty fast-paced (in a good way) with a few players. However I had a game go for almost 2 hours when it was just me and one of the kids. Not recommended if you're a Monopoly purist though or if you're teaching kids how to play Monopoly since it's very different. No hotels, no multiple houses, no utilities, no railroads, no Chance or Community Chest, no Income or Luxury Tax... spaces are removed or replaced with the other Chance/CC-type cards you play with. Also only 4 players max! The rent level thing is easily tracked on the device so there's no need to keep moving the houses around as the level goes up and you can just scan a property if you care/forget what level the property is.",neutral,positive

The box had a dent in the back and two pieces were damaged at that site, but are still functional.",positive,positive
Czech Games Codenames,"Fun party style game. Have played with 4 and 6 players. Game is good with 4 players, but prefer the higher play counts (probably up to 8 players would be good). Game plays fast 15-20 minutes (depending how long the code master takes to come up with clues and how long team takes to make a decision). If there are players that take too long there is a timer to speed things up, but we have never used it.  This game is light, but it is more of a party game so that is to be expected. Games very easy to learn and everyone picked it up within minutes. Fun game and the price is good. The replayability is great since there are 200 double sided cards. Glad we purchased this game.",positive,positive
"Throw Throw Burrito by Exploding Kittens - A Dodgeball Card Game - Family-Friendly Party Games - Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids - 2-6 Players","I love this game. It was first introduced to me at a get together we have once a year with the boys. We play games online together all year around, but once a year we get together in person to play physical games. One of the guys pulled this game out one night when we had a little too much to drink and it was the funniest game of the whole weekend. I bought it as soon as I got back home. I have not been disappointed. It's easy to transport, easy to explain, and easy to play. Makes for a great party game. I got hit directly in the eye(lid) with a burrito and it's so soft my only reaction was to laugh. I don't think it's possible to hurt someone with these burritos. I don't know what they're made of... they're softer than marshmallows yet they will last forever (unless your dog gets one maybe?).",positive,positive
SET Enterprises Five Crowns Card Game Purple,"We played this game at friends' house and liked it! I bought it for us for Christmas. It is a fun, quick game to play, very easy to learn and definitely giftable to anyone who likes card games. You can go all 13 rounds but even if you don't have time for all of them, you can stop after any round. It is fun how you get more cards with each round 😊. We really like this game and would recommend it to others. We also bought 'Karma' card game. Made by the same company! We are split in the family which one is out favorite 😁! We have a team 5 Crowns and team Karma, and end up paying both games at game nights 😁.",positive,positive

Fisher-Price Little People Animal Friends,"So much nicer than expected, and a great value for the price. I purchased the safari set, and on the first day, my 2-year old was saying “raff” for giraffe,  “ohno” for rhino, and now she growls the word “bear” whenever she picks it up. I know a lot of reviews complain about the quality of the farm animals, but it’s mainly a defect in the chicken. I purchased the big farm set from Target, and everything looks great, but the chicken beak lines up weird just like the pictures in the negative reviews. It doesn’t matter though because she still says “Bok-bok” when she plays with it. My little one has been struggling with a language delay because of the pandemic, and playing with these animals has been like a key that  unlocked her first words. SO happy with this purchase!",positive,positive

"LEGO Star Wars: The Mandalorian Trouble on Tatooine 75299 Awesome Toy Building Kit for Kids Featuring The Child, New 2021 (277 Pieces)","This review is for anyone looking to save money. Let's be honest, people are buying mandalorian sets for the figures, not the set pieces. So if you buy this instead of the razor crest you get the superior version of Mando, the child and a tusken raider which I think is way cooler than a scout trooper. So is paying $100 more for the razor crsst worth it? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Plus it's not like IG-88 can't be assembled from any random battle droid anyway. Wait until you can buy the razor crest on its own on eBay for 30-40 and get this set so you have Mando and the child",negative,positive

Water Doodle Mat - Kids Painting Writing Doodle Toy Mat - Color Doodle Drawing Mat Bring Magic Pens Educational Toys for Age 2 3 4 5 6 7 Year Old Girls Boys Age Toddler Gift,"Best money ever spent. I bought this for a Christmas gift for my 3 y.o. She loves to color and draw but I'd rather not have her room destroyed with markers and paint. The ""markers"" and ""brushes"" are little tubs that you fill with water and it transfers ""colors"" onto the mat. The mat is cute and big enough for her to spread out. I also like that it's quick drying and erases itself. My only complaint are the blue tube ""brushes"". They are made of super thin plastic and when my little one accidently sat on it, it broke and made a hole in the full tube, making it useless. The red/white markers are thicker material and are still holding up!",positive,positive

"Exploding Kittens - A Russian Roulette Card Game, Easy Family-Friendly Party Games - Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids - 2-5 Players","My kids and their friends would probably play this game every weekend. I think they like it because you can gang up to use cards to totally destroy another player, or protect your friends. Probably the same reason I'm not that crazy about it. It's pretty fun, but eventually I'll get tired of a bunch of the kids trying to take out the same person every round, and have to call it quits. At that point it's just not fun anymore. The rules are pretty easy, and they have some more complicated ones to add on once everyone is really competent at the game. As long as everyone at the table plays without prejudice, it does take some strategy to win, not just all luck. Though if you have a really bad hand, and draw bad cards, you really don't have a chance. If you don't play it as an out to get that person, game, it's pretty fun. Though 4 rounds is about all I can handle because it's pretty repetitive.",neutral,positive

Casdon Dyson Ball | Miniature Dyson Ball Replica For Children Aged 3+ | Features Working Suction To Add Excitement To Playtime,"I had a vacuum like this as a child, a Dirt Devil, and that was a lot better quality. This one doesn’t want to stay standing without leaning against something. It has one very small hole in the bottom to pick up debris off of the floor. The suction is pretty good considering it’s a toy but you have to line it up perfectly with whatever you are trying to vacuum. I like that it has a separate switch for the suction and the little spinning bits in the front. Would be nice it was rechargeable, it uses 4 C batteries. Also the part that goes along the floor spins all the way around so it keeps getting stuck upside down during use by young children. It’s a nice little machine for what it is, but it should cost less than it does. I probably wouldn’t buy this again or as a gift.",neutral,positive

Had really hoped these were good, and they look cute and sit nicely on lower fridge as magnets, but the whole point was to give the small children something to look at, learn from, play with safely, not to have to keep removing from their little hands and pull paper off of them!

"Elongdi Water Beads Pack Rainbow Mix 50,000 Beads Growing Balls, Jelly Water Gel Beads for Spa Refill, Kids Sensory Toys , Vases, Plant, Wedding and Home Decor","I was excited to get these for my sensory bin at work. I poured a good amount in and added the water. It took about 2.5 to 3 hours before they got to their full size. Slightly smaller than a pea. They also break easily and leave a weird film on your hand after you play in them. I am going to rinse them off and try it again tomorrow. I am not really happy with them because I was expecting bigger. The kids were excited by them so I guess that is all that matters.  I still plan on finding some larger ones. Also, my bottle did not come with a plastic covering over the top. I just opened the top and beads fell everywhere.",neutral,negative
"Bundaloo Claw Machine Arcade Game | Candy Grabber & Prize Dispenser Vending Machine Toy for Kids, with Music | Best Birthday & Christmas Gifts for Boys & Girls (Red Claw)",I bought this for our grandson’s birthday. We couldn’t find it anywhere except for Amazon. He absolutely loved it. The music was very loud and the volume could not be adjusted. Before I purchased it I read many reviews that mentioned be extra careful when unwrapping the claw itself. We followed those suggestions. The next day the claw would not open. My grandson was disappointed. We decided to return it. We didn’t want to replace it. I was afraid the same thing might happen again. We decided to give our grandson an Amazon gift card.,negative,negative

"Animals Figure,54 Piece Mini Jungle Animals Toys Set,ValeforToy Realistic Wild Vinyl Plastic Animal Learning Party Favors Toys for Boys Girls Kids Toddlers Forest Small Animals Playset Cupcake Topper","I was very pleased upon opening of this package to find that it included such rare and wonderful creatures. It was so surprising to see such an actual likeness of a squirrel. Seeing as we never go outside or look out our windows, this creature is very strange and foreign to us. So foreign that we believed it belonged in a animal playset featuring animals you’d normally only find in a zoo. We were also happy to see the inclusion of the rarely seen endangered pink moose. As I’m sure my fellow animal lovers know, 10,000 years ago only pink moose roamed the wastes of the tundra. Now, they are quite rare and it’s good to see such a fine specimen. I was shocked by how anatomically correct they are in size, as you can see from my pictures. In fact, the squirrel we mentioned earlier was crafter to scale, and matched the size of the elephant quite perfectly! Who could have known they were such large and majestic creatures!? However, as a good Christian, I was disappointed to see the inclusion of two of satans creatures among gods creations. I was, sadly, uninformed until this wonderful product showed me the truth. As you can see from the blood red eyes and black fur, the black bear and gorillas are obviously hellspawn, sent by the devil himself to help tempt us from the ways of the light. I am, however, also proud to see that these were manufactured in part in a friends hometown in China. I included the picture of the packaging to show it as well. It is liwenwujinmujujiagongdian,dalingshanzhenyangwucundisangongyequdaxinglu180,dongguang,guangdong,China. Boy that’s a mouthful.",positive,negative

Yahtzee,"The instructions and examples on the directions seem to be a little easier to understand than in the old Yahtzee games. ButI don't like the shape of the shaker cup. Although it fits in your hand better than a regular cup, you can't set it on the table after your turn without the dice falling out because of the odd size.",neutral,positive

My Little Pony Toys Meet The Mane 6 Ponies Collection (Amazon Exclusive),"Ok for starters I bought this for Christmas for my 2 year old daughter. She LOVES MLP! And you can’t find all six as accurate as these, HOWEVER while they are pretty durable body wise … Their TAILS can be removed or even BROKEN EASILY. After discovering them popping off I bought super glue just so they would stay. However now instead of popping out they break clean off. Which really sucks considering these toys are pretty pricey. So I guess what I’m saying is that I wouldn’t recommend buying these for small kids.ALSO pinky pie had a leg that came broken in mail.",neutral,positive

PicassoTiles 2 Piece Car Truck Construction Kit Toy Set Vehicle Educational Magnet Building Tile Magnetic Blocks Puzzle Magnets Toys with Re-Enforced Hitch and Long Bed for Girls Boys Toddler Ages 3+,"I ordered this set.. and my grandsons, four year old twins, LOVED them. They complement their other Picasso sets perfectly.. so perfectly that I ordered another set for them and then ordered two more sets for my 2yr and 3yr old granddaughters! I confess, the two colors in each pack made them perfect. It ended up two blues for one child and two reds for the other. On days when sharing comes easier they all go together in one long train! The kids enjoy building trains engines, pulling cars with zoo animals tucked inside, fire trucks, cars, rockets to the “launch pads”.. all sorts of wheeled creations.",positive,positive
"Polly Pocket Unicorn Party Large Compact Playset with Micro Polly & Lila Dolls, 25+ Surprises to Discover & Fun Princess Party Play Areas: Bouncy House, Castle, Swings, Water Floatie & More",Daughters both love playing with this thing and all the accessories that are inside. The bouncy castle is cool but nobody would know that the little dolls can only stay stuck to it if u put the stickers that come with the kit on the floor of it. Otherwise they fall over. They've been playing with it alot so I feel it is worth the money. The kids told me where they wanted the little stickers so that the dolls could stick to and stand all over the inside of the wonderland/castle. Works great.,positive,positive

"ThinkFun Zingo Bingo Award Winning Preschool Game for Pre-Readers and Early Readers Age 4 and Up - One of the Most Popular Board Games for Boys and Girls and their Parents, Amazon Exclusive Version",I bought this game to play with my 4 and 8 year old sons hoping it would help with their reading. The game is like bingo. You get a card and you have to match the tiles to the pictures on your card. Maybe there are too many tiles but it seems like the same tiles always shows up and the game just drags looking for the last one. I also don't think my sons are looking at the words but looking at the pictures instead. Doubt I would buy this game again.,negative,neutral

"Star Wars The Child Animatronic Edition 7.2-Inch-Tall Toy by Hasbro with Over 25 Sound and Motion Combinations, Toys for Kids Ages 4 and Up , Green","Much MUCH smaller than I thought and poor packaging. How does something this expensive, not have a plastic covering on the front of the box to protect it? Mine came scuffed up. I really don't think this is worth 60 bucks unless you are a super fan. For the price, it should come with extras like a little bowl with a frog and shifter knob. But even then it's not worth 60 bucks. Strongly considering making a return.",negative,negative
"Barbie Doll Mermaid with Light-up Tail! [Amazon Exclusive] , Blonde","The mermaid is fine, if boring. The real issue is that all Barbies are attached to the packaging with plastic tags that stick in their head and are unremovable.

Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza,"Funny thing: I bought this game a year ago when we got shut inside thanks to Covid's arrival, and we JUST opened it this weekend and played it. It was just forgotten all this time and I seriously regret that we've missed out on a year of the laughs this game gives my family! We have SO much fun together and I'm very grateful for the new activity to smile together with! For whatever reason, I am physically unable to hold back a scream/grunt/shout/or any other weird sound anytime we have to SLAP! We've played it twice for at least an hour and a half each time and I've already bought one to give my nieces so they can enjoy, too! :)",positive,positive

I'm not sure how she will do but for $3 I figured it was worth the gamble. It really is a small amount of sticks (I think there's like 8 in there) but like I said, who knows if she will even like the way these feel in her hands so it could be totally fine that I didn't spend more money to get more sticks.",positive,positive

Made By Me Create Your Own Window Art - Paint Your Own Suncatchers - DIY Suncatchers - Arts and Craft Kits for Kids Ages 6 and Up,This was really fun to do with my 5 year old. I took off a star because there’s not enough paint to paint every shape in the set. Not even close. And idk where to find more special paint like this that will dry see-through. Took off another star bc some of the shapes have a hole that is too small to fit the suction cup thing through so we can’t hang them up and are left over with a lot of useless suction cups.,positive,neutral
"Funko Five Nights at Freddy's Articulated Freddy Action Figure, 5""","I could not tell you in words how bad of experience my kid had with this one and the Foxy that I just bought.  First the Foxy arrived and the same arm that broke on Freddy broke on Foxy.  The bottom of the arm fell off and the connection cracked which means it could not be taped or even glued.  He was so disappointed (he's seven years old)..  It had arrived that day and broke the same day, Foxy has been wrapped for return already.  Freddy has broken today, he just came out the parcel box yesterday.  So disappointed for my kid cause he love these characters and their videos.  He waited to get these and try to make a collection.  These toys are made so you cannot fix them and they expect you to buy more.  Save your money and buy some other collectives.  I would not give one star if i didn't have to, these toys deserve none.

LOL Surprise Deluxe Present Surprise™ Series 2 Slumber Party Theme with Exclusive Doll & Lil Sister,"Nice LOL set but wasn’t expecting the box to be filled with plastic confetti. Two and a half weeks after Christmas, I’m still finding pieces here and there. Fortunately it’s sort of thick plastic instead of colored paper that could stain the carpet if it got wet.

Disney Encanto Mirabel Doll with Singing Feature and Magical Light Up Butterfly,"This is an excellent Disney toy for such a great movie that is very colorful and sturdy. 5 Stars if you leave it in the packaging. We had a heck of a time opening this product like all Disney toys with much non-recyclable waste, again a common practice for Disney product for many years.  A no packaging option from Amazon would make Parents and kids happy (hey my kids want the toy, they NEVER save the packaging)and would help eliminate some waste for our environment that we all live in. And seems like a responsible thing for 2 huge companies to begin. Disney and Amazon, you have a responsibility!",positive,neutral

"Funko Pop! Star Wars: The Mandalorian - Mandalorian (Chrome), Amazon Exclusive, Multicolor","When I originally preordered this Funko POP back in December 2019, it was advertised to be close to a fully chrome POP.  The helmet and the metal pieces of armor were supposed to be chrome.  However, this POP only had a chrome helmet.  Not exactly what I had hoped for.  It's still a nice POP, but would be better if I received what I paid for.  Also, since I keep my POPs in the display boxes, I was disappointed to find some damage to the exterior of the box even though it arrived double-boxed, which means it was damaged before it was placed in the sorter box and finally placed in the shipping box.",neutral,neutral

"Mexican Train Dominoes Game in Aluminum Carry Case, for Adults, Families and Kids Ages 8 and up","My 5 year old Granddaughter lives right in back of me so I see her everyday.  She is always wanting to do something. I bought this game after visiting out in California as the family we were visiting play this game serveral times a week.  I really got into it. I purchased it cause it was attactively packaged in a metal case, great for putting away.No cardboard box to break down and all the pieces fit into the case. The dimmono's are great quality and great for small fingers.I didn't think she could do it but caught on fast. It taught her matching and counting and color and especially waiting her turn.  I don't let her win, but when she does she loves blowing the train whisle.  We have a great time together playing Mexican Train and for the summer it was most every day. I also have a two year old grandson that can't play yet but loves playing with the pieces stacking and building. It is a great toy as well as a game and I love the metal case.",positive,positive

The beads are very tiny and I did not think they would amount to much. To try them, I used about a tablespoonful in a large bowl and added water. After an hour or so, I realized I needed to add more water. And more. And more. That tablespoon of beads ended up making about a gallon of colorful gel balls. There is something very relaxing about running your hands through them and letting them sift between your fingers. They have a great tactile feel and provide a great sensory experience. When the grandkids were done playing with them, I sealed them in a gallon ziploc bag and sent them home with them so I am not sure how long they stayed pliable.",neutral,positive
SKIP BO Card Game,My mother likes her skip-bo cards she has in the same color of the picture. She wore hers out and needed a replacement deck but did not like the new design colors that are at Walmart.

Purchasing this was a waste of time.,negative,negative

The bad part was when I hot the doll I had to wash it right away because it had a strong odor of urine on it and inside the bag it came inside of. But my daughter oves the doll.,neutral,positive
"Just Play Children’s Single Use Face Mask, Paw Patrol, 14 Count, Small, Ages 2-7",The masks have a plastic instead of a metallic piece along the nose so it doesn’t really keep it’s shape and kind of pops out a bit- defeating the purpose of the mask by creating a gap along the area. These masks are also slightly smaller than another nonbrand one that also had Hello Kitty on them. Those are better than these due to size and the metallic nose clip.,neutral,negative

Everything came in packaged nicely and ready to use. I also like that it comes with the lacing harness so that we don't lose the stylus. The color isn't as vivid as I thought it would be.  Perhaps it may have been a heat issue during delivery as the manual did state to keep it in cooler temps. It doesn't bother me too much, but there are more cool tones than an array of colors.",positive,positive

We have gotten this paint on clothes, carpet, upholstery, etc. and it really does come out with little to no effort at all. My son uses the same paint at daycare and we have never had an issue with it not coming out of his clothing, even after it has been dried on there for hours.",positive,positive

"Power Your Fun Robo Pets Unicorn Toy for Girls and Boys - Remote Control Robot Toy with Interactive Hand Motion Gestures, STEM Toy Program Treats, Walking and Dancing Robot Unicorn Kids Toy (Pink)","My daughter absolutely loves this! She hasn't stopped playing with it since she got it Christmas morning. The remote control is powered by 3 AAA batteries. The controls are a little difficult to understand in the beginning due to it having small pictures that show what each button does but it only took my 7 year old 5 minutes to master it. The battery last pretty long on the unicorn itself. There are LED indicators on the eyes that show when it's charging, charged, and needs charged. All in all, a very highly recommended gift.",positive,positive
Bicycle Dice 10 Pack,"I really enjoy beautiful and artistic dice, and I appreciate that market immensely. Sometimes you just want simple dice though, something to just throw out for typical games and these fit the bill for that nicely.

I have no idea what we could've done wrong.  I would not recommend this.",negative,negative

"Exploding Kittens - A Russian Roulette Card Game, Easy Family-Friendly Party Games - Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids - 2-5 Players","Just a ridiculously stupid game. We played one round; there was nothing exciting or crazy or tense or fun or anything that would cause one to remember the experience, much less recommend it to anyone else. As a family, we voted and all agreed that the game should be destroyed in a shredder rather than returned so that others could not be exposed to something we once owned. Luckily, this game lowers the bar so much that your entire party can breakout in a random game of ""I Spy My Little Eye"" and have more fun. Or, maybe shove a No. 2 pencil deep in an eye socket?",negative,negative
"Kinetic Sand, The Original Moldable Sensory Play Sand Toys for Kids, Green, 2 lb. Resealable Bag, Ages 3+","I prefer this brand to any other we’ve tried. And as a Mom, I’d encourage you to stick with the natural color! I have no problem with cleanup, the rest of our home is in tans and browns LOL). I made a sensory bin out of a stainless cooking pan that came with a lid (also found here on Amazon) so that’s how we store this until it needs to be replaced. We’ve added some trucks and tractors, wooden play dough rollers, as well as mini sandcastle molds from a National Geographic set (their sand sucks).

Then I discovered the paint went through and dried all over the table. First pic is after washing with hot/soapy water and a sponge. Second is after 10 mins of scrubbing with a magic eraser. I don't know yet if the table is ruined and needs to be sanded down and refinished. We finger paint regularly and I have never had this happen before.

When his dad set up the figures and said a dinosaur name he was able to  choose most of them correctly on his first try.

I found the music that the vehicles played to be really annoying. The other negative, the car goes forward straight and only reverses backwards into a turn. It does not reverse straight backwards. Also, make sure to have plenty of batteries on hand. I think it needed a total of 10 for the cars and remotes. Batteries are not included. I hope it doesn’t drain quickly. Also, I wish it wasn’t labeled as 18 months + on the box. Makes it seem like this toy is for babies meanwhile 3 and 4 year olds enjoyed playing with it. I’m hesitant to gift this to a 3 year old boy because of that labeling as it makes it seem like a babyish toy. And after I purchased it, I found the same exact toy for much cheaper on another site. So I do feel a bit ripped off.  But at least my daughter enjoys playing with it.",positive,neutral

Funko Disney The Haunted Mansion - Call of The Spirits: Magic Kingdom Park Edition Game,"My 9 year old grandson loves the haunted mansion, so I got this for him so we could play it. Wow. Absolutely horrible instructions. Got in several YouTube videos and still, 5 of us had no idea how you play this. You are never told what order a turn goes, when you move from seance room to hall edge, anything at all. You have 3 stacks of cards that mean different things on each turn, then you have a duel tomb stone looking thing where if you are In The same  room as another player you can duel (I understood that part, but thought it was a very stupid idea), and then a wheel you can turn in the middle of the board you can turn as far as you want. Then you place the haunt cards in the rooms going counter clockwise by the number on a card plus 3. It just made no sense. We all just stared at each other confused and then boxed it up and set it aside. My grandson told me I could use it to start my fire pit if I wanted to. Reading about this made it seem something like clue, but this nothing like clue, and even what we did understand made no sense. Good luck.",negative,negative

"LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Mario Starter Course 71360 Building Kit, Interactive Set Featuring Mario, Bowser Jr. and Goomba Figures (231 Pieces)","I only gave a second star for the theory behind this set. In practice, it's a 0-1 star fail I'm afraid. The app is poor, at least on android devices. I can't speak for iOS, but that's next on my list to try. The required app is unreliable and crashes if it even opens. I'm in the IT industry so I know my way around troubleshooting software. For this reason, this set is not gift able unless you can support the technology component. Aside from the app not working on multiple devices, the set itself cannot be built unless you have the working app. Building instructions are not included in print form. You can download a 74pg PDF if you want. Though even that solution makes this set far less likely to engage a child under the age of 9 or 10 independently. Critical thinking and problem solving skills are one thing I like to engage in my kids during their Lego play and this set is likely to mean that an adult will need to intervene or even lead the play. In theory, a supplemental instructions app for Lego sets is a great idea. Accessibility possibilities that aren't available in print would likely be an advantage to some users. But for Lego to make digital building support the only option for users is really poor in practice. It assumes kids have technology, have technology support readily accessible to them, and it also assumes the app works, which it does not on android platforms. My kids were so excited about this and now they're very disappointed. In theory, good idea; execution, 1 star at most. Lego needs to dispatch some kind of supplemental print option for this set to close the divide they've fostered.",negative,negative

We have 2 kids who are English as a 2nd language, so we really love games that don’t require reading, or loads of talking. Our ESl kids are 13 and 12, so they don’t want baby games, and this checks all the boxes! Our 7 year old also learned how to play very quickly and this game really helps him with math in a fun way. Also, the game is meant to end when someone reaches 100 points, but we’ve never played that long.

"Exploding Kittens - A Russian Roulette Card Game, Easy Family-Friendly Party Games - Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids - 2-5 Players","This game is exceptionally fun. Easy to learn - my 7 year old family member picked up on it in no time. I have bought two extra games to gift to others, and I have purchased all the expansion packs. The major issue is that many of the expansion packs that have been sent out have issues. Mine were that the cards were mis-cut (and therefor misshaped) as well as a slightly different shade of red. This makes it easy to spot an expansion card in the deck 7 easy to manipulate the game. Another issue is that the cards wear out easily. NOW, I emailed the exploding kittens support box, and they were kind enough to send me a brand new deck and brand new expansion pack. That was very kind of them, and anyone else with the same issue should email them as well (their email inbox is on their website).! But the fact that they knowingly ship out cards with issues to buyers is not acceptable. I love playing this game and I'd rate 5/5 if the cards were more durable and the company was responsible enough to ensure the quality of the expansions before sending out.",positive,neutral

Melissa & Doug 20 Wooden Animal Magnets in a Box,"I bought these for my 14-month-old son. He loved to play with the magnets on the fridge, but there were several that were either too small, too delicate or not durable enough for him to play with. I got this box of animal magnets and stuck them to the bottom of the fridge. He happily plays with them while I'm busy in the kitchen. So far, I have had no issues with the animals peeling off or anything, and they stick very well to the fridge. The front of our fridge is a little bit curved, and these magnets still stick very firmly. The magnets stick out from the fridge enough so my son can easily grab onto them, too, which isn't the case for some of our other magnets. My only complaint is that some of the animals are kind of small, so I don't feel comfortable letting my son play with those while he still puts everything in his mouth. I kept these up higher on the fridge so he can't reach them. I think there are about 5 or 6 of them. But the majority of them are big enough.",positive,positive

LOL Surprise OMG Moonlight B.B. Fashion Doll - Dress Up Doll Set with 20 Surprises for Girls and Kids 4+,"As soon as I saw a picture of Moonlight, I ordered her. I love goth dolls and thought this one was particularly appealing. I received her yesterday and generally, I'm pleased. There are just a couple of things I thought could be done better: packaging and hair. MGA is notorious for packaging that is laborious to open and for putting lots of styling gunk into dolls' hair, and sadly, Moonlight is no exception. Trying to get the doll and items out of the packaging without destroying either was frustrating and time-consuming. Then once she was out, I could see that the back of her hair was a mess, and not easily combed because it was also crunchy with gel or lacquer or whatever they use. So I took one star off for that reason. Is she a pretty doll that I'll enjoy having? Yes. I just wish MGA would improve in these two areas.",positive,positive

Point is- the cap on this block set is easily removable, so I will fill the bucket with the blocks, cap it, and put it in front of her. She will take the cap off with no issue then, dunk it all out. It fascinates her. Adding the shapes into the ""cut outs"" also catches her interest. It's something I see her playing with for at least a year. Eventually building up to putting the shapes in the ""cut-outs"" herself, and then next being able to name the shapes and colors once she starts talking, etc, etc. Simple play set...Big impact.",neutral,positive

Melissa & Doug Examine and Treat Pet Vet Play Set (24 pcs),"We got this after already getting the Melissa and Doug doctor set, and upon looking at the box, I thought we'd made a mistake.  At first glance, it looked like a lot of the pieces would be duplicates leading to boredom.  I think there's 6 exact duplicates, plus a few more that are very similar.  But my daughter loved the two plush animals that came with it and really enjoyed playing with the cast and cone. If I could do it again, I would definitely buy this kit instead of the doctor set next time.

"UNO Family Card Game, with 112 Cards in a Sturdy Storage Tin, Travel-Friendly, Makes a Great Gift for 7 Year Olds and Up [Amazon Exclusive]","Playing games has been  a great way to keep busy during the pandemic lockdown. I like that playing cards with my husband gives us a break from the TV, and also gives us time together. Many other nights, he's watching a game on TV and I'm reading a book and even though we're the only ones in the house, we're not together. While we're sitting at the same table playing cards, we have a lot of laughs, and we look forward to playing Uno every evening. One slight criticism - after only a few uses, the cards began to stick together - not like they'd been glued or anything, but you have to be careful not to pick up too many cards. But as an inexpensive, fun way to keep busy for hours, I'm not going to complain too much!",positive,positive

Like how a lot of the M&D food items have a sound or visual function... These items do not. The Nutritious Nibbles, Quick Cure and Help Make Boo Boos Disappear are all empty. No noise or touch items and nothing to put in them. They're usually famous for adding extras into toys to increase role play fun and imagination, so I was hoping for that. It is a cool set and I'm sure my children will enjoy it. I'm a long time purchaser of Melissa & Doug toys and I was just hoping for something more.

Mom decides she wants to play with us ""kids"" sooo there is a Seal with a smug content smirky look on his face. Judge is reading through the selected cards for the Meme. Then reads, ""The look on your face when you already came and she keeps sucking."" Mouths drop. Faces get red. We all look at each other in disbelief of what our youngest cousin just read out loud in front of Mom. Who we can't look in the eyes, but peeked just to make sure she didn't have a heart attack. Mom didn't seem nearly as disturbed as us. I immediately blurt...I had no idea this game was THAT bad. But we proceed. My cousin declares that statement took the cake and said it was the best one. Mom jumps up and screeches That was Mine. I win. And Laughs allowed. We all just look at each other like OMG! Mom was the rotten one to play that card. BUT it was a hilariously fun night.

"Monopoly Game: Ultimate Banking Edition Board Game, Electronic Banking Unit, Game for Families and Kids Ages 8 and Up (Amazon Exclusive)","There is a lot of fun to be had with this game if you are one of those casual Monopoly players that want a different way to play while also having a great electronic banking unit keep track of all your money and property values for you. But there are some rule changes to some of the core mechanics and other new stuff to be aware of. - You CANNOT trade properties with other players, unless game effects do otherwise. - When in jail, you DO NOT collect rent from others or raise the rent. It is a MANDATORY rule in this version. - There is no utilities or R.R.s in the game. There is a new go anywhere space if you pay 100. Doing this, you DO NOT pass GO. - Event cards replace community chest and chance cards. They vary in different effects. - No houses or hotels can be bought. Instead, you use a house on the property when purchased to track rent levels that increase from other players and even you landing on them. They also increase when all the properties of a color set is purchased, even if it's a split Monopoly. (Ex: Player 1 has two orange and player 2 just bought the 3rd orange. That will cause all the orange properties to go up one rent level. Two levels if it's a solo player monopoly.) and event cards that can also raise or even lower rent. - When in the negative, you sell your properties for face value to the player you owe money to. The rent level stays where it is. (If you owe the bank, it'll remove the rent tracker) - The game ends when ONE player goes bankrupt (indicated by a siren horn from the unit) and then totals up all player remaining money and property values. The highest amount is the winner. Pros - Banking unit is very easy and fun to use. Keeps track of everything really well. - No need for a banker. Everyone can be involved. - Less game components to worry about losing. - Plays quicker than a regular game of Monopoly Cons - Device will need batteries (3 AAA) and a screw driver to remove the battery door. - Only up to 4 players instead of the usual up to 6. - Mover tokens are a cheap plastic. This version of Monopoly is really great for those who want to play a quicker game while an electronic device keeps track of everything for them in-game. So for the Monopoly purists, this is definitely not the version for you. But give it a try when you can. You may be surprised.",positive,positive

LEGO Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Resistance A Wing Starfighter 75248 Advanced Collectible Starship Model Building Kit (269 Pieces),"I got this for myself, as I am an adult nerd, who loves star wars, legos and spaceships, but I don't feel like I can afford to spend lots of money on larger lego sets. This kit is great though.  If you're looking for a lego spaceship to woosh around the room, it's a good fit for anyone short of small children (contrasting to larger lego spaceships that are too big, or sometimes a little too fragile to enthusiastically ""fly"" them around the house).  If you're looking for a nerdly room decoration, it's a fine looking A-Wing, well proportioned to the ship as it appears in movies. As a toy it has some cool features too.  The folding landing gear looks neat compared to how the older A-Wings that sat on their tail fins.  The spring loaded missiles are a neat addition, and the launch buttons well hidden on the finished model (like you know where the buttons are, but they're not like a massive obvious tab).  You can point the guns on the sides of the ship up and down like the ""real"" A-Wing too. The minifigs are neat.  The pilot's helmet even has a little transparent bit that matches the visor on pilot's helmets in the movies.  The non-pilot figure is a nice addition, she mixes well with some of the other rebel/resistance soldiers I have on my ""shelf of nerd things"" So in a nutshell it's a very nice A-Wing lego set for a whole 26 dollars.  While it's smaller and less parts than some of the other Star Wars Lego sets, it feels like you get way more ""ship"" for your money than other choices.  Highly recommended.",positive,positive

LEGO Classic Creative Suitcase 10713 Building Kit (213 Pieces),I bought this for my 4y.o girl. She enjoyed it but there are many very tiny pieces that her little fingers can't handle.

Got2Glow Fairy Finder - Electronic Fairy Jar Catches Virtual Fairies - Got to Glow (Pink),"Huge disappointment. Quite possibly one of the saddest excuses for a gift I've ever seen. Total waste of money. 1985 Graphics, and ludicrous ""games"" that do nothing. The fairies are pixelated and don't look anything like fairies.  Basically it is a nightlight you hear some music and see a light and then all of a sudden you have a fairy.  There's supposed to be an interactive but the website and the qr code dont work.  Just terrible.",negative,negative
"Crayola Colored Pencils Adult Coloring Set, Gift, 100 Count","First thing I noticed is it doesn't seem to matter which way you colour, lines don't show and instead these give a solid, even look. Then I realized they're considerably waxier than other coloured pencils I've used, almost as if they're crayons, but with the fine point of a pencil. The colours selection is fantastic, although I had to rearrange them in the internal sleeves to make more sense in hues. I do wish the box and sleeves were better suited to seeing the colours as I have to pull out multiple pencils to get the one I want. But overall, theses are perfect for adult colouring books with their mix of tiny and large spaces to fill. They also sharpen easily and without much waste.",positive,positive
"Play-Doh Modeling Compound 10-Pack Case of Colors, Non-Toxic, Assorted, 2 oz. Cans, Ages 2 and up, Multicolor (Amazon Exclusive)","Look, people are complaining these are so ""tiny."" Well, it states the size in the description and isn't the seller's fault if you miss it or don't realize a full size is twice this size. If you want tiny, go for the 1 oz instead of these 2 oz containers. This is actually the perfect size for me. I get stiff hands/fingers and need to knead them. I use stress balls, too big. I used putty, too hard to move & rubs blisters on my fingers. Play-doh is just the right consistency and it has that great smell i remember from my childhood. Just what I need in the size I need. If you want to use it for sculpting, maybe go for the full size. Enjoy!",positive,positive

"LEGO Flower Bouquet 10280 Building Kit; A Unique Flower Bouquet and Creative Project for Adults, New 2021 (756 Pieces)","Goes quickly, even with the number of pieces in the kit.

Still, cute to have and a fun way to spend an evening.",positive,positive
Spy Ninjas New Recruit Mission Kit from Vy Qwaint and Chad Wild Clay,My son watches youtube and was crying for this. I found it on Amazon and ordered. It is a bunch of junk and crap that he wont have in 24 hours. Its sad that people make a living screwing over young kids.,negative,negative

"Reborn Baby Dolls, Realistic Newborn Baby Dolls, 18 inch Silicone Real Toddler Girl Lifelike","We purchased this doll as a Christmas gift for our 7 yr old daughter & it was, by far, her very favorite gift under the tree. Two months later, she is still in love. This baby doll is of excellent quality for what we paid. The texture of her skin is soft & pleasant to the touch. She has realistic eyelashes. She is sturdy in weight, feeling more realistic in the arms of my little girl & even resting on my shoulder. Ultimately, imaginary play with this baby doll is effortless. If I had to issue any complaint, it would be that her hair is a little bit unmanageable. The fringe of her bangs is long in her eyes & due to the way the hair is stitched into her head, it makes it difficult to comb or style differently. But that is the extent of any shortcomings we've discovered with this sweet, lovable baby doll.",positive,positive
"Crayola Twistables Colored Pencil Set, School Supplies, Coloring Gift,50 Count","Do not buy this set of Crayola Twistable colored pencils.  They are the worst I've ever owned.  The leads are extremely waxy and do not color well.  It's like there's no pigment.  It takes a great amount of pressure to get the color on the paper (even the dark colors) and when you do this, the lead will break or it slides back into the pencil.  I have an old set of these and they're okay but this new set is not worth the money.",negative,negative

"Learning Resources Helping Hands Fine Motor Tool Set Toy - 4 Pieces, Easter Toys for kids, Ages 3+ Fine Motor and Sensory Play Toys, Toddler Tweezers, Sensory Bin Toys",I purchased these after seeing every Waldorf teaching mom on Instagram posting about them. Today I introduced them to my 2 year old. He doesn’t quite get them yet but he enjoyed scooping with them in his cloud dough sensory bin. Only reason I am deducting a star is because the yellow scoop/tweezers no longer close together properly. My son barely used them & I can’t for the life of me get them to line back up properly so they are basically useless. I would still buy again though.,positive,positive
Barbie Club Chelsea Camper,"I bought the Barbie Club Chelsea Camper set for my 3 1/2 year old grand daughter for this coming Christmas, who is just starting to play with dolls.  The Chelsea dolls are so much easier for smaller hands to play with than the larger Barbie dolls.  The Camper set is going to really make her happy because she can use her imagination to have adventures.  She likes to play with her kitchen set and loves cars.  She will be able to take her Chelsea doll for a ride with or without the camper, open up the camper and have Chelsea take a nap, play in the little kitchen and even has a little puppy to name and include in the fun.  We can pretend to have a picnic, and cover up in the camper.  I really like that this set includes a doll and everything she will need to have hours of fun.",positive,positive
Melissa & Doug Wooden Pizza Play Food Set With 36 Toppings,"I just got this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter.  She loves to play with it.  She experiments with different toppings and loves to 'serve' us pizza when she's done 'cooking' it in her play kitchen.  She really likes to cut with the little pizza cutter included. We've only had it a few days so I can't comment on durability but it seems to me that it will hold up fine.  I think the paint will eventually start to wear and I suppose after repeated use, the velcro might become weakened but other than that I see no negatives with this toy.  For the price, it was well worth it.  She will get a lot of use from this I think. Well made too - my daughter is pretty rough with her toys and since this is all wood construction (even the box is thick wood) it will stand up to her abuse.",positive,positive
Hasbro Gaming Guess Who? Game Original Guessing Game for Kids Ages 6 and Up for 2 Players,My children love this game.

On first flight, the fairy flew from our hand and kept going, up over the roof, up over the neighbor's roof and continued to fly way up into the sky and out of view. We searched everywhere to find it but it may have ended up flying back to the manufacturer for all we know. So word of warning- don't fly it outside??? Not really sure how you can even play with this if it destroys everything inside and will fly far away from you forever if you fly it outside. My daughter was devastated and this was a terrible purchase.",negative,negative

I would love to return it for a refund but my son loves it too much and doesn’t understand anything about quality. There are holes/missing pieces out of the white pad part and the lines have not smoothed out yet.

"Hasbro Gaming Candy Land Kingdom Of Sweet Adventures Board Game For Kids Ages 3 & Up (Amazon Exclusive), Red","The game shown in the picture is not the game you get. The graphics have been totally redone. Maybe I just don't like change, but I was very disappointed when I opened the box and set it up. Will toy manufacturers ever understand that when parents purchase a classic like this, that they themselves played as kids, they want it too look similar to what they played with as kids? Even my 9 year old was disappointed when, after sitting down to play with his 3 year old sister, he realized that there was no Peppermint Forest, no Rainbow Trail, no Gramma Nut, no Jolly or Plumpy, and the fairy princess Frostine has been replaced by Moxie Girl wannabee. The new graphics are garish and distract from the classic simplicity of the game. There is really not a bare space on the board. That said, my 3 year old enjoys it and it is helping me teach her to take turns, be a polite winner and a graceful loser.",negative,neutral

It isn’t a bad game, but we felt like we fumbled through it and made rules as we went to make up for the lack of guidance with the included instructions. It isn’t worth $19.99. It should be maybe a $9 card game.",neutral,neutral

"Safari Animals Figures Toys, Realistic Jumbo Wild Zoo Animals Figurines Large Plastic African Jungle Animals Playset with Elephant, Giraffe, Lion, Tiger, Gorilla for Kids Toddlers, 12 Piece Gift Set",So the plastic quality isn’t great... they don’t look to be one solid piece more like pieces glued together. The real issue I have with these though are that they are marketed for toddlers and they have graphic genitals on them. I will include pictures for reference. It is obvious... I had them for maybe an hour before noticing the giraffe d*** and then quickly checked the others.. so yea don’t get these for your kids if you don’t like penises on toy animals. I wasn’t a fan. Update: amazon won’t let me add pictures. But I’m not the first to write this... read all the reviews.,negative,negative
"Crayola Washable Kids Paint, 6 Count, Painting Supplies, Gift, Assorted",These pains came a little bit smaller than I had expected. I guess I did not look at how many ounces each jar was. We were able to paint at least 10 times taking up a whole very long Paper on our Melissa and Doug art easel. We also use the Crayola paint brushes which worked very well. The paint came off the brushes very very easily even after drying overnight. This paint also washes off of clothes and skin without leaving any color behind  and also comes off very easily from everything from wood floors to clothing. I was so comfortable with my 2 1/2 year-old using this paint in the kitchen while I was in the other room and confident that if she did get it on something then we can get it off easily. This paint is thick enough that if a child gets a glob of paint and the paint brush it doesn't just dropped off. The paint is a gel but is the perfect amount of thickness. Save yourself the money and skip buying the smaller product but by the larger jugs of the same product.  You will not be disappointed.,neutral,positive

We already had about 200 Magnatiles and purchased the 100 piece set for him this Christmas.

Ticket to Ride Board Game | Family Board Game | Board Game for Adults and Family | Train Game | Ages 8+ | For 2 to 5 players | Average Playtime 30-60 minutes | Made by Days of Wonder,"The game itself is fun, but I question whether it is for 8 and up. We played this without kids the first go-around. 4 academics agree, that this may not work for young kids. Regardless it’s a fun game. There’s some strategy to it. My only complaint is that the board didn’t lay flat making some of the pieces fall over. (Small detail)",positive,positive

"Cephalofair Games Gloomhaven: Jaws of The Lion Strategy Boxed Board Game for ages 12 & Up , Brown","Where do I start? I'll keep it simple. If you have a group of friend who wants to try something new as an alternative to dnd games. This maybe be for you. I had for so many times in my wishlist the original game but I didn't buy it because of its price and the commitment that you need to have with your friends. So after looking for so many times I discovered this little gem. So I didn't think it twice and bought the game. To my surprise, this was one of the best decisions ever!! I'm playing it with 3 more friends and every weekend we form our group and play one scenario. I read online that this game has more or less 18 - 20 hours of gameplay, thing that is perfect for us who didn't want a game for example like dnd that you have to spend like 2 years on a campaign and also the learning process. This game is so perfectly crafted for new players, that is designed for you to understand the game while you play the scenarios. Every token and item is so perfectly crafted, and everything just fits. I'm only gonna tell you If you like board games and want something that doesn't require so much commitment and want an adventure, with a good story and gameplay. This is the game for you. Give it a chance and believe you won't regret it.",positive,positive
